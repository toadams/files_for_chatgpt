Introduction
This final rule requires all public utility transmission providers to adopt revised

pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Procedures (LGIP), pro forma Small
Generator Interconnection Procedures (SGIP), pro forma Large Generator
Interconnection Agreements (LGIA), and pro forma Small Generator Interconnection

Agreements (SGIA).1 These revisions will ensure that interconnection customers are able
to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely
manner, and will prevent undue discrimination.
Twenty years ago the Commission issued Order No. 2003, in which the
Commission required all public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities used for
transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce to have on file standard procedures
and a standard agreement for interconnecting generating facilities larger than 20
megawatts (MW) (called the pro forma LGIP and the pro forma LGIA).2 The
Commission stated its expectation that the changes would prevent undue discrimination,
preserve reliability, increase energy supply, and lower wholesale prices for customers by

1

Section 201(e) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) defines “public utility” to mean
“any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission
under this subchapter.” 16 U.S.C. 824(e). A non-public utility that seeks voluntary
compliance with the reciprocity condition of a tariff may satisfy that condition by filing a
tariff, which includes the pro forma LGIP, the pro forma SGIP, the pro forma LGIA, and
the pro forma SGIA. See Standardization of Generator Interconnection Agreements &

increasing the amount and variety of new generation that would compete in the wholesale
electricity market.3 The Commission further stated that the standard procedures would
facilitate market entry for generation competitors by reducing interconnection costs and
time.4 In Order No. 2006, the Commission adopted standard procedures and a standard
agreement for interconnecting generating facilities no larger than 20 MW (called the
pro forma SGIP and the pro forma SGIA), citing the same purposes outlined in Order
No. 2003.5
The electricity sector has transformed significantly since the issuance of Order
Nos. 2003 and 2006. The growth of new resources seeking to interconnect to the
transmission system and the differing characteristics of those resources have created new
challenges for the generator interconnection process. These new challenges are creating
large interconnection queue backlogs and uncertainty regarding the cost and timing of
interconnecting to the transmission system, increasing costs for consumers. Backlogs in
the generator interconnection process, in turn, can create reliability issues as needed new
generating facilities are unable to come online in an efficient and timely manner. While

the Commission recognized these issues and sought to address them in Order No. 845,6 it
is clear that further action is needed. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to reform
the Commission’s standard interconnection procedures and agreements to ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, thereby ensuring that rates, terms, and
conditions for Commission-jurisdictional services are just, reasonable, and not unduly
discriminatory or preferential.
Accordingly, we adopt reforms to the Commission’s pro forma LGIP and pro
forma LGIA. Specifically, as explained in detail in this final rule, we adopt reforms to:
(1) implement a first-ready, first-served cluster study process;7 (2) increase the speed of
interconnection queue processing; and (3) incorporate technological advancements into
the interconnection process.

A first-ready, first-served cluster study process improves efficiency in the
interconnection study process by including the following elements: increased access to
information prior to entering the queue; a mechanism to study interconnection requests in
groups where all interconnection requests in the group are equally queued and of equal
study priority; and increased financial commitments and readiness requirements to enter
and proceed through the queue. In contrast, the existing first-come, first-served serial
study process in the pro forma LGIA and LGIP provides limited information to
interconnection customers prior to entering the queue, assigns interconnection requests an
individual queue position based solely on the date of entry into the queue, and contains
limited financial and readiness requirements.

First, in order to implement a first-ready, first-served cluster study process, this
final rule requires: (1) transmission providers to publicly post available information
pertaining to generator interconnection; (2) transmission providers to use cluster studies
as the interconnection study method; (3) transmission providers to allocate cluster study
costs on a pro rata and per capita basis; (4) transmission providers to allocate network
upgrade costs based on a proportional impact method; (5) interconnection customers to
pay study and commercial readiness deposits as part of the cluster study process; (6)
interconnection customers to demonstrate site control at the time of submission of the
interconnection request; and (7) transmission providers to impose withdrawal penalties
on interconnection customers for withdrawing from the interconnection queue, with
certain exceptions. We also require transmission providers to adopt a transition process
to move from the existing serial interconnection process to the new cluster study process.
Second, in order to increase the speed of interconnection queue processing, this
final rule: (1) eliminates the reasonable efforts standard for conducting interconnection
studies and imposes a financial penalty on transmission providers that fail to meet
interconnection study deadlines; and (2) establishes an affected system study process and
associated pro forma affected system agreements.
Third, in order to incorporate technological advancements into the interconnection
process, this final rule requires transmission providers to: (1) allow more than one
generating facility to co-locate on a shared site behind a single point of interconnection
and share a single interconnection request; (2) evaluate the proposed addition of a
generating facility at the same point of interconnection prior to deeming such an addition

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

-7-

a material modification if the addition does not change the originally requested
interconnection service level; (3) allow interconnection customers to access the surplus
interconnection service process once the original interconnection customer has an
executed LGIA or requests the filing of an unexecuted LGIA; (4) use operating
assumptions in interconnection studies that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an
electric storage resource; and (5) evaluate the list of alternative transmission technologies
enumerated in this final rule during the generator interconnection study process. This
final rule also requires interconnection customers requesting to interconnect a nonsynchronous generating facility to: (1) provide the transmission provider with the models
needed for accurate interconnection studies; and (2) have the ability to maintain power
production at pre-disturbance levels and provide dynamic reactive power to maintain
system voltage during transmission system disturbances and within physical limits.
Finally, this final rule requires that all newly interconnecting large generating facilities
provide ride through capability consistent with any standards and guidelines that are
applied to other generating facilities in the balancing authority area on a comparable
basis.
We also adopt reforms to the pro forma SGIP and pro forma SGIA. Specifically,
as explained in detail in this final rule, for small generating facilities we propose reforms
to incorporate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies into the
interconnection process, and to provide modeling and ride through requirements for nonsynchronous generating facilities.

Many of the reforms adopted in this final rule track the Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking’s8 (NOPR) proposed reforms closely. However, as discussed more fully
below, we have revised aspects of the reforms pertaining to the cluster study process,
allocation of cluster study and network upgrade costs, increased financial commitments
and readiness requirements, financial penalties for delayed interconnection studies, the
affected system study process, pro forma affected system agreements, the material
modification process, operating assumptions for interconnection studies, incorporating
the enumerated alternative transmission technologies, and ride through requirements.
Additionally, as discussed more fully below, we decline to adopt the NOPR proposals
pertaining to informational interconnection studies, shared network upgrades, the
optional resource solicitation study, and the alternative transmission technologies annual
report.
We recognize that transmission providers have undertaken efforts to address
interconnection queue management issues. This final rule is not intended to divert or
slow the potential progress represented by those efforts, and we encourage transmission
providers to continue to innovate to remedy their identified interconnection queue
management issues. We note that the compliance obligations that result from this final
rule will be evaluated in light of the independent entity variation standard for regional

A.

Historical Framework: Order Nos. 2003, 2006, and 845

In Order No. 2003, the Commission recognized a need for a standard set of
interconnection procedures for transmission providers and a single, uniformly applicable
interconnection agreement for large generating facilities.10 The Commission noted that
generator interconnection is a “critical component of open access transmission service
and thus is subject to the requirement that utilities offer comparable service under the
[pro forma open access transmission tariff (tariff)].”11 The Commission found that it was
appropriate to establish a standard set of generator interconnection procedures to
“minimize opportunities for undue discrimination and expedite the development of new
generation, while protecting reliability and ensuring that rates are just and reasonable.”12
To this end, the Commission adopted the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA and

amended its regulations to require all transmission providers to incorporate these standard
procedures and agreement into their tariffs.13
To initiate the generator interconnection process set forth in the Commission’s pro
forma LGIP,14 the interconnection customer submits an interconnection request for its
proposed generating facility that includes preliminary documentation of the site of the
proposed generating facility, certain technical information about the proposed generating
facility, and the expected commercial operation date of the proposed generating facility,
along with a refundable deposit of $10,000.15 After the transmission provider determines
that the interconnection request is complete, the interconnection request enters the
transmission provider’s interconnection queue with other pending interconnection
requests and is assigned a queue position based on the time and date of its receipt.16 The
queue position determines the order in which the transmission provider studies the
interconnection requests in its interconnection queue.17

18 CFR 35.28(f)(1) (2022).

14

While we provide a broad description of the process in the Commission’s pro
forma LGIP as background here, we recognize that many transmission providers have
adopted (and the Commission has accepted) variations to many of the terms in the
Commission’s pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA. Consequently, some or many of
the details of a particular transmission provider’s generator interconnection procedures
may vary considerably from the broad description provided here.

Transmission providers must schedule a scoping meeting with the interconnection
customer to discuss possible points of interconnection for the proposed generating facility
and exchange technical information, which is followed by a series of interconnection
studies to evaluate the proposed interconnection in detail.18 Transmission providers study
interconnection requests in three phases: (1) the interconnection feasibility study
(feasibility study);19 (2) the interconnection system impact study (system impact study);20
and (3) the interconnection facilities study (facilities study).21 These studies contain the
power flow, short circuit, and stability analyses necessary to: (1) identify any adverse

19

The pro forma LGIP defines a feasibility study as “a preliminary evaluation of the
system impact and cost of interconnecting the Generating Facility to the Transmission
Provider’s Transmission System.” The scope of a feasibility study is described in section 6
of the pro forma LGIP. Pro forma LGIP sections 1, 6.
20

The pro forma LGIP defines a system impact study as “an engineering study
that evaluates the impact of the proposed interconnection on the safety and reliability of
Transmission Provider’s Transmission System and, if applicable, an Affected System.”
In particular, a system impact study identifies and details “the system impacts that would
result if the Generating Facility were interconnected without project modifications or
system modifications, focusing on the Adverse System Impacts identified in the
[feasibility study], or to study potential impacts, including but not limited to those
identified in the Scoping Meeting.” Id. section 1.
21

The pro forma LGIP defines a facilities study as “a study conducted by the
Transmission Provider or a third-party consultant for the Interconnection Customer to
determine a list of facilities (including Transmission Provider’s Interconnection Facilities
and Network Upgrades as identified in the [system impact study]), the cost of those
facilities, and the time required to interconnect the Generating Facility with the
Transmission Provider’s Transmission System.” The scope of a facilities study is
described in section 8 of the pro forma LGIP. Id. sections 1, 8.

impacts on the transmission providers’ transmission system or any affected systems;22
(2) determine the interconnection facilities and network upgrades23 needed to reliably
interconnect the generating facility; and (3) estimate the interconnection customer’s cost
responsibility for these facilities.24 The pro forma LGIP requires that transmission
providers use reasonable efforts to complete: (1) feasibility studies within 45 calendar
days; (2) system impact studies within 90 calendar days; and (3) facilities studies within
90 or 180 calendar days, depending on the interconnection customer’s requested accuracy
margin.25
At the completion of the facilities study, the pro forma LGIP requires the
transmission provider to issue a report on the best estimate of the costs to effectuate the
requested interconnection and provide a draft generator interconnection agreement to the

22

The pro forma LGIP defines an affected system as an electric system other than
the transmission provider’s transmission system that may be affected by the proposed
interconnection. Id. section 1; pro forma LGIA art. 1.
23

For purposes of this final rule, unless otherwise noted, “network upgrades” refer
to interconnection-related network upgrades. More specifically, the pro forma LGIP and
pro forma LGIA provide that, “Network Upgrades shall mean the additions,
modifications, and upgrades to the Transmission Provider’s Transmission System
required at or beyond the point at which the Interconnection Facilities connect to the
Transmission Provider’s Transmission System to accommodate the interconnection of the
Large Generating Facility to the Transmission Provider’s Transmission System.” Pro

interconnection customer.26 If the interconnection customer wishes to proceed, after
negotiations, the interconnection customer enters into a generator interconnection
agreement with the transmission provider or, in specific circumstances, requests that the
transmission provider file the agreement with the Commission unexecuted.27 The
transmission provider is responsible for the construction of all network upgrades, but, as
further discussed below, the interconnection customer has the option to build these
facilities in certain circumstances.28
Similar to Order No. 2003, in Order No. 2006, the Commission recognized the
need for standardized interconnection procedures and agreements for small generating
facilities with a capacity of 20 MW or less.29 In addition to establishing a pro forma
interconnection study process for small generating facilities similar to the process for

26

Order No. 2003, 104 FERC ¶ 61,103 at P 38. Section 11.1 of the pro forma
LGIP requires the transmission provider to tender a draft LGIA to the interconnection
customer “in the form of Transmission Provider’s FERC-approved standard form LGIA.”
27

If the transmission provider and interconnection customer execute an LGIA that
conforms to the transmission provider’s Commission-approved standard form LGIA, the
agreement does not need to be filed with the Commission (if the transmission provider
has such a standard form LGIA on file and submits an Electronic Quarterly Report).
Alternatively, the transmission provider must file an LGIA with the Commission for
review and approval if: (1) the interconnection customer determines that negotiations
with the transmission provider over the terms of an LGIA are at an impasse and requests
submission of the unexecuted LGIA with the Commission; or (2) the LGIA does not
conform to the transmission provider’s Commission-approved standard form LGIA. See

large generating facilities established in Order No. 2003, the Commission included: (1) a
“fast track process”30 that uses technical screens to evaluate a certified small generating
facility no larger than 2 MW; and (2) a “10 [kilowatt (kW)] inverter process”31 that uses
the same technical screens to evaluate a certified inverter-based small generating facility
no larger than 10 kW.32 The Commission later issued Order No. 792,33 in which the
Commission revised the pro forma SGIP and pro forma SGIA to provide for
interconnection customers to receive point of interconnection information in advance of
submitting an interconnection request, increase the threshold for participation in the fast
track process to five MW, and to specifically include electric storage devices.34
In response to concerns voiced to the Commission about interconnection queue
management, in 2007, the Commission held a technical conference,35 and later issued an
order36 addressing interconnection queue issues in RTOs/ISOs. In the order, the

Commission noted that some transmission providers were not processing their
interconnection queues within the timelines established in the pro forma LGIP, and in
certain cases, were greatly exceeding them.37 The Commission stated that, although it
“may need to [impose solutions] if the RTOs and ISOs do not act themselves,” each
RTO/ISO would have an opportunity to work with its stakeholders to develop its own
solutions.38 As further discussed below, following the order, multiple RTOs/ISOs
submitted queue reform proposals to the Commission, some of which moved away from
a so-called “first-come, first-served” approach (whereby interconnection requests are
processed in the order they are received) to a so-called “first-ready, first-served”
approach (whereby interconnection requests are processed based on when
interconnection customers meet certain project development milestones).39 The reason
for this move was to allow interconnection customers with interconnection requests for
generating facilities more likely to achieve commercial operation to move faster instead
of being delayed by interconnection requests that were higher in the interconnection
queue but making limited or no progress towards commercial operation and creating
unreasonable queue delays.

In 2018, the Commission issued Order No. 845, in which the Commission made
the most comprehensive revisions to the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA since their
adoption in Order No. 2003. In Order No. 845, the Commission concluded that reforms
to the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA were needed to mitigate concerns regarding
systemic inefficiencies, remedy discriminatory practices, and address recent
developments, including changes in the resource mix and emergence of new
technologies.40 The Commission therefore adopted reforms designed to improve
certainty for interconnection customers, promote more informed interconnection
decisions, and enhance the generator interconnection process.41

Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator
Interconnection Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

On July 15, 2021, the Commission issued an Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (ANOPR) in Docket No. RM21-17-000, presenting potential reforms to the
Commission’s requirements governing the regional transmission planning and cost
allocation and generator interconnection processes.42 Specific to the generator
interconnection process, the Commission sought comment on whether and which reforms
may be necessary to ensure a more purposeful integration of the generator

interconnection process with the regional transmission planning and cost allocation
processes, establish a faster and more efficient interconnection queueing process, and
promote a more efficient and cost-effective allocation of network upgrade costs.43 For
instance, the Commission noted that the cost of network upgrades can depend largely on
both the timing of when the interconnection customer enters the interconnection queue
and where the interconnection customer proposes to interconnect its generating facility.
Therefore, the Commission noted, interconnection customers may submit multiple
interconnection requests in an effort to determine the most favorable point of
interconnection44 that minimizes their network upgrade costs.45 The Commission stated
that this practice, in turn, may lead to late-stage withdrawals of the excess
interconnection requests, which can then impede the transmission provider’s ability to
process its interconnection queue in an efficient manner. As a result, the Commission
stated that it may be time to consider reforms to the generator interconnection process
that would make it more efficient and ensure that generating facilities that are more
“ready” than others are not unduly delayed in the interconnection queue.

On April 21, 2022, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation NOPR) proposing reforms to its existing
regional transmission planning and cost allocation requirements in the same proceeding
as it issued the ANOPR.46 While the Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation NOPR
did not address many of the concerns raised by the Commission in the ANOPR with
respect to the generator interconnection queue process, the Commission noted in the
Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation NOPR that it would continue to review the
record and that it expected to address possible inadequacies through subsequent
proceedings that propose reforms, as warranted, related to that topic.47 The Commission
took that next step with the reforms proposed in the NOPR in this proceeding, many of
which we adopt in this final rule.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

On June 16, 2022, the Commission issued the NOPR, proposing reforms focused
on improving aspects of the pro forma LGIP, pro forma LGIA, pro forma SGIP, and pro

manner.48 Among those, the Commission proposed to: (1) require transmission
providers to offer an optional informational interconnection study to serve as additional
information for prospective interconnection customers in deciding whether to submit an
interconnection request and set minimum requirements for transmission providers to
publicly post available information pertaining to generator interconnection;49 (2) require
transmission providers to implement a first-ready, first-served cluster study process that
allocates costs associated with cluster studies and identified network upgrades consistent
with the discussion below;50 and (3) impose more stringent financial commitments and
readiness requirements on interconnection customers, including increased study deposits,
more stringent site control requirements, a commercial readiness framework, and higher
withdrawal penalties.51 To implement these reforms, the Commission also proposed to
require transmission providers to establish a transition process.52
Second, the Commission proposed three reforms to increase the speed of
interconnection queue processing, including: (1) revisions to eliminate the reasonable
efforts standard for interconnection study processing;53 (2) revisions to establish an

agreements;54 and (3) revisions to establish an optional resource solicitation study.55
Finally, the Commission proposed three reforms to incorporate technological
advancements into the interconnection study process. With these reforms, the
Commission proposed to require transmission providers to: (1) increase flexibility in the
generator interconnection process by allowing generating facilities to co-locate, allow the
interconnection customer to request the addition of a generating facility to an existing
interconnection request, increase the availability of surplus interconnection service, and
allow interconnection customers to propose operating assumptions for their generating
facilities;56 (2) incorporate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies into the
interconnection study process at the request of the interconnection customer;57 and (3) list
required modeling standards for inclusion in all interconnection requests that include
inverter-based resources (IBRs), as well as require certain performance standards from
IBRs during system disturbances.58

Joint Federal-State Task Force on Electric Transmission

On June 17, 2021, the Commission established a Joint Federal-State Task Force on
Electric Transmission (Task Force) to formally explore broad categories of transmissionrelated topics.60 The Commission explained that the development of new transmission
infrastructure implicated a host of different issues, including generator interconnection.
The Task Force is comprised of all FERC Commissioners as well as representatives from
10 state commissions nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners (NARUC), with two originating from each NARUC region.61 The
Task Force convenes for multiple formal meetings annually, which are open to the
public. Since its creation and as of the date of issuance of this final rule, the Task Force
has met seven times.
The discussion at the May 2022 meeting focused on interconnection issues,
including generator interconnection queue processes and backlogs. The Task Force

tighter applicant requirements to enter and remain in the queue, clustering, fast tracking,
tighter deadlines on transmission providers completing studies, and minimizing
reiterative studies); and how to balance near-term improvements to the interconnection
procedures with longer-term regional transmission planning and development.62

Overall Need for Reform
A.

NOPR

In the NOPR, the Commission noted that the serial first-come, first-served study
process was adopted at a time when most interconnection requests were for large
traditional generating facilities that would use readily available transmission capacity.63
The Commission stated that the continued use of this process in the face of dramatic
changes to the electric power industry, principally the surge in interconnection requests,
the rapidly changing resource mix, evolving market forces, and the emergence of new
technologies, has led to a growing backlog of interconnection requests and study delays
for many transmission providers.64 The Commission also stated that these
interconnection queue backlogs and study delays create uncertainty and inhibit project

developers’ ability to interconnect generating facilities to the transmission system.65 The
Commission preliminarily found that the existing pro forma LGIP, pro forma LGIA,
pro forma SGIP, and pro forma SGIA may be insufficient to ensure that new generating
facilities are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner and to thereby ensure that rates, terms, and conditions for
Commission-jurisdictional services are just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or
preferential.66 Further, because the interconnection queue backlogs and study delays
afflicting generator interconnection service nationwide hinder the timely development of
new generation and thereby stifle competition in the wholesale electric markets, the
Commission also preliminarily found that the Commission’s pro forma LGIP, pro forma
LGIA, pro forma SGIP, and pro forma SGIA result in rates, terms, and conditions in the
wholesale electric markets that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or
preferential.

The Commission stated that its preliminary findings were based on several
features of the Commission’s existing generator interconnection procedures and
agreements that are of concern, specifically: (1) the information (or lack thereof)
available to prospective interconnection customers and the commitments required of
them to enter and progress through the interconnection queue; (2) the reliance on a serial
first-come, first-served study process and the standard to which transmission providers
are held for meeting interconnection study deadlines; (3) the protocols for affected
systems studies; (4) the provisions for studying new or hybrid generation technologies
and considering alternative transmission technologies; and (5) the performance
requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities, including wind, solar, and
electric storage facilities.67
The Commission found that some of the same issues persist in the small
generating facility context and, therefore, proposed limited reforms to the pro forma
SGIP and pro forma SGIA to incorporate alternative transmission technologies into the
interconnection process and to provide modeling and performance requirements for nonsynchronous generating facilities.68

an urgent need to clear the current generator interconnection queue backlog and to
facilitate timely and economic interconnection of new resources in a way that responds to

underway across the country to fix individual transmission provider interconnection
queue processes, there is still a need for the Commission to address backlogs and
improve certainty in the interconnection queue process.72 Several commenters assert that
these interconnection backlogs have resulted in commercial uncertainty regarding both
the magnitude of identified upgrade costs and the timeline for completion of
interconnection studies, delayed project development, increased costs for consumers due

are not prepared to move forward with their projects, in order to secure a favorable
position in the interconnection queue or in an attempt to obtain locations with available

interconnection request triggers reassessments and possible restudies by the transmission
provider that can increase the timing and interconnection cost for lower-queued
interconnection requests. Several commenters point to ambitious climate goals (such as
the United States’ commitment to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% by
2030 under the Paris Climate Agreement) and argue that: (1) these changes will likely
spur greater investment in new generation and exacerbate the delays in processing
interconnection requests; and/or (2) without an efficient and transparent interconnection
process, none of the clean energy generating facilities intended to meet these goals can be

pertinent factors affecting interconnection queue sizes, such as an increase in the
development of smaller, more diverse generating facilities.82
Three comments note that various transmission providers use vastly different

generic one-size-fits-all reform, arguing that queue reform is best left to the regional

Several commenters generally support the suite of proposed reforms in their
entirety.92 As discussed in detail in each section below discussing individual reforms,
most commenters either support specific proposals or suggest that the Commission

Some commenters support adopting most or all of the limited reforms to the pro

Resources asserts that including the proposed reforms in the pro forma SGIP is necessary
to reflect the operating assumptions of, and to provide equitable treatment for, microgrids
and other behind-the-meter resources.97 Microgrid Resources asserts that, if the
Commission succeeds in expediting interconnections for large generating facilities, while
small generating facility interconnections languish, it will bias the system against smaller
local generating facilities that are the backbone of community resilience.

preliminary findings in the NOPR concerning the need for reform99 and, pursuant to FPA
section 206, conclude that certain revisions to the pro forma open access transmission
tariff and the Commission’s regulations are necessary to ensure rates that are just,
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Specifically, we find that the
existing pro forma generator interconnection procedures and agreements are insufficient
to ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission
system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, thereby ensuring that rates,
terms, and conditions for Commission-jurisdictional services are just, reasonable, and not
unduly discriminatory or preferential. Absent reform, the current interconnection process
will continue to cause interconnection queue backlogs, longer development timelines, and
increased uncertainty regarding the cost100 and timing of interconnecting to the
transmission system. These backlogs and delays, and the resulting timing and cost
uncertainty,101 hinder the timely development of new generation and thereby stifle

are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential.
Indeed, recent data support the Commission’s preliminary findings in the NOPR
that the dramatic increase in the number of interconnection requests and limited
transmission capacity are increasing interconnection queue backlogs across all regions of
the country.102 As of the end of 2022, there were over 10,000 active interconnection
requests in interconnection queues throughout the United States, representing over 2,000
gigawatts (GW) of potential generation and storage capacity.103 This potential generation
is the largest interconnection queue size on record, more than four times the total volume
(in GW) of the interconnection queues in 2010, and a 40% increase over the
interconnection queue size from just the year prior.104 These trends are not exclusive to
any one region of the country. Instead, every single region has faced an increase in both

for RTO/ISO and non-RTO/ISO regions alike. The non-RTO/ISO west and southeast
regions both have faced queue size increases ranging from tripling to a 12-fold increase
while also seeing longer timelines between interconnection requests and commercial
operation dates.106 Furthermore, the uncertainty and delays in the interconnection queues
have resulted in fewer than 25% of interconnection requests, by capacity, reaching
commercial operation between 2000 and 2017 in any region of the country—with some
regions as low as 8%.107
Additionally, recent data continue to show that interconnection customers are
waiting longer in the interconnection queue before withdrawing their interconnection
requests,108 even as overall interconnection study timelines are increasing in many
regions.109 For example, AEE states that, as of February 2022, all 2,274 projects waiting

have persisted and worsened. For generating facilities built in 2022, wait times in the
interconnection queue saw a marked increase to now roughly five years.114
Delays in the interconnection study process are an important contributor to
interconnection queue backlogs nationwide. For instance, based on the recent
interconnection study metrics transmission providers posted in compliance with Order
No. 845, of the 2,179 interconnection studies completed in 2022, 68% were issued late.115
Furthermore, at the end of 2022, an additional 2,544 studies were delayed (i.e., ongoing
and past their deadline).116 All of the RTOs/ISOs except CAISO and 14 non-RTO/ISO
transmission providers reported delayed studies at the end of 2022.117
Consistent with the NOPR, we find that numerous factors have contributed to the
increasing volume of interconnection requests, including a rapidly changing resource

mix, market forces, and emerging technologies. For example, the interconnection queues
in all parts of the country are now predominantly made up of comparatively new
technologies that have operating characteristics and generally shorter construction cycles
that were not taken into account when the Commission issued Order No. 2003, such as
solar, battery storage, and hybrid resources, as older, larger generating facilities retire.118
The Colorado Commission notes that solar projects account for roughly half of the
cumulative requests in the five RTO/ISO queues and likely an even greater percentage of
the most recent requests.119 In addition to the drastic increase in the number of
interconnection requests in all regions of the country, evidence shows that
interconnection studies have increased in complexity since the Commission issued Order
No. 2003, potentially straining transmission provider resources.120 At the same time, we
find that available transmission capacity has been largely or fully utilized in many
regions, creating situations where interconnection customers face significant network

upgrade cost assignments to interconnect their proposed generating facilities.121 For
example, as referenced by the U.S. DOE, a recent report finds that interconnection costs
in MISO doubled for generating facilities for which the interconnection studies were
completed between 2019 and 2021 as compared to those completed prior to 2019, and
cost estimates tripled for proposed generating facilities still active in the interconnection
queue between the same time periods.122 These cost increases are similar to those being
faced in NYISO and PJM, where interconnection costs, per kW, have doubled (or more)
for recently completed generating facilities.123 As a result, we find that this combination
of increased volume of diverse interconnection requests and insufficient transmission
capacity leading to higher costs to interconnect, which can result in interconnection

request withdrawals, has resulted in longer interconnection queue processing times and
larger, more delayed interconnection queues.
In response to comments asserting that the Commission did not take into account
other factors affecting interconnection queue sizes, such as the development of smaller,
more diverse generating facilities, in its preliminary findings on the need for reform in
the NOPR,124 we find that the record shows that interconnection queue sizes are
increasing in both number of interconnection requests and in total MW capacity in all
regions of the country and such increases are not due to an influx of any particular size of
proposed generating facility. Moreover, data show that the median duration for all
generating facilities that enter the interconnection queue hovers around 30 months,
independent of the size of the interconnection request.125
Interconnection queue backlogs and delays have created uncertainty for
interconnection customers regarding the timing and cost of ultimately interconnecting to
the transmission system. We agree with commenters that such uncertainty, on the part of
both transmission provider and interconnection customer, may lead to an increase in costs

124

See, e.g., Pine Gate Reply Comments at 4 (stating that “the days of . . . large,

to consumers.126 First, delayed interconnection study results or unexpected cost increases
can disrupt numerous aspects of generating facility development.127 Cost uncertainty
poses an especially significant obstacle because interconnection customers may not be
able to finance substantial increases in unexpected interconnection costs. Second,
transmission providers may face uncertainty regarding the size and makeup of the
interconnection queue and the commercial viability of the project in the interconnection
queue, creating inefficiencies in the study process, increasing interconnection study costs,
and delayed study results. Such uncertainty, either on the part of transmission providers
or interconnection customers, are ultimately passed through to consumers through higher
transmission or energy rates.128 Increases in energy rates may result from wholesale
customers having limited access to new and more competitive supplies of generation.
Conversely, efficient interconnection queues and well-functioning wholesale markets
deliver benefits to consumers by driving down wholesale electricity costs.
As the interconnection queue backlogs and study delays continue and even
increase, we find that the Commission’s existing rules contained in the pro forma LGIP,
pro forma LGIA, pro forma SGIP, and pro forma SGIA result in rates, terms, and

conditions for Commission-jurisdictional services that are unjust, unreasonable, and
unduly discriminatory or preferential. Not only do the problems described above lead to
an inability of interconnection customers to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, they also hinder the timely
development of new generation, thereby stifling competition in the wholesale electric
markets. We, therefore, find that reform to the Commission’s existing pro forma
generator interconnection procedures and agreements is necessary.
Our findings that the existing pro forma LGIP, pro forma LGIA, pro forma SGIP,
and pro forma SGIA must be reformed are based on the following features of these
existing rules: (1) the information (or lack thereof) available to prospective
interconnection customers and the commitments required of them to enter and progress
through the interconnection queue; (2) the reliance on a serial first-come, first-served
study process and the “reasonable efforts” standard that transmission providers are held
to for meeting interconnection study deadlines; (3) the protocols (or lack thereof) for
affected system studies; (4) the provisions for studying new generating facility
technologies and evaluating the list of alternative transmission technologies enumerated
in this final rule; and (5) the modeling or performance requirements (or lack thereof) for
non-synchronous generating facilities, including wind, solar, and electric storage
facilities. We discuss each of these five features below.
First, we find that existing pro forma generator interconnection procedures and
agreements fail to contain a process by which an interconnection customer can obtain
information about potential interconnection costs at a specific location or point of

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 44 -

interconnection prior to submitting an interconnection request. Without this information,
it is difficult for interconnection customers to assess the commercial viability of a
specific proposed generating facility prior to entering the interconnection queue.129
Furthermore, we find that for interconnection customers, the pro forma interconnection
procedures and agreements fail to include meaningful financial commitment
requirements to enter and stay in the interconnection queue and lack of stringent
requirements to establish the commercial viability of proposed generating facilities.130
As a result, interconnection customers often submit multiple interconnection requests for
proposed generating facilities at various points of interconnection, knowing that not all of
the proposed generating facilities will reach commercial operation, as an exploratory
mechanism to obtain information to allow the interconnection customer to choose to
proceed with the interconnection request representing the most favorable site in terms of
potential interconnection-related costs.131 For instance, recent interconnection study

interconnection applications simply intended to solicit information discovery from the
transmission provider . . . is a significant defect in today’s queue process”); Google Initial

interconnection process,” with transmission owners and their affiliates having greater
access than independent power producers to information on the relative cost of
interconnection at different points).
130

See, e.g., Dominion Initial Comments at 4 (stating that “owners of speculative
projects remain in the queue process for as long as they possibly can in the hopes that
their project somehow becomes viable”); U.S. Chamber of Commerce Initial Comments

and readiness requirements on interconnection customers”).

metrics posted by transmission providers continue to show that some interconnection
customers are withdrawing interconnection requests before any studies are completed.132
While interconnection customers may withdraw at any stage of the interconnection
process, to do so before any study is completed indicates that interconnection customers
may lack information prior to entering the interconnection queue and are entering to
obtain valuable information about the commercial viability of their proposed projects
vis-à-vis other interconnection customers in the queue or cluster.
Second, the existing serial first-come, first-served study process in the pro forma
LGIP requires transmission providers to process interconnection requests in the order in
which the transmission provider receives them. This approach creates incentives for
interconnection customers to submit exploratory or speculative interconnection requests
pursuant to which interconnection customers seek to secure valuable queue positions as
early as possible, even if they are not prepared to move forward with the proposed
generating facility. Such generating facilities are often not commercially viable and,
thus, the interconnection customers ultimately withdraw from the interconnection queue.

We agree with commenters that the withdrawal of speculative interconnection requests
that trigger reassessments and possible restudies by the transmission provider can delay
the timing and increase the cost to interconnect for lower-queued interconnection
requests.
In summary, we find that the lack of (1) access of information about a specific
location or point of interconnection prior to submitting an interconnection request and
(2) meaningful financial commitments in the pro forma interconnection procedures and
agreements for interconnection customers to enter and stay in the interconnection queue,
as well as the existing serial first-come, first-served study process, all incentivize
interconnection customers to submit speculative interconnection requests that contribute
to interconnection study backlogs, delays, and uncertainty, and, in turn, unjust and
unreasonable Commission-jurisdictional rates.
We disagree with commenters’ assertions that there is no basis to find that
speculative interconnection requests are responsible for interconnection queue backlog
and delays. We highlight that more than 70% of interconnection requests were
withdrawn from the interconnection queue between 2000 and 2017.133 Although we
recognize that there are various reasons an interconnection customer may withdraw its
request from the interconnection queue, a withdrawal indicates an inability to reach
commercial operation. Because a withdrawal can trigger costly restudies and create

uncertainty in the interconnection process for interconnection customers and transmission
providers alike, withdrawals of commercially non-viable interconnection requests from
the interconnection queue is a significant contributing factor to interconnection queue
backlogs and delays.134 Late-stage withdrawals of interconnection requests are also
increasing.135 Late-stage withdrawals present a significant problem, as they can trigger
restudies for other interconnection customers that can result in significant increases to the
interconnection costs attributed to those customers and the timeline for completion of
interconnection studies, which can result in further late-stage withdrawals, thus
exacerbating the interconnection queue backlogs and delays.136
We also find that interconnection queue backlogs and delays, and the
accompanying uncertainty, are further compounded because transmission providers have
limited incentive to perform interconnection studies in a timely manner. Under the
pro forma LGIP, transmission providers are held to a “reasonable efforts” standard in
completing interconnection studies consistent with their tariff-imposed deadlines.
However, this standard offers significant discretion to the transmission providers in
extending their own deadlines. The record demonstrates that a majority of transmission

providers across the country regularly fail to meet interconnection study deadlines.137
Despite pervasive delays in completing interconnection studies by transmission
providers, we acknowledge that transmission providers have faced few, if any,
consequences for failing to meet their tariff-imposed study deadlines under the
reasonable efforts standard.138 This outcome stands in stark contrast to interconnection
customers that face financial and commercial consequences due to late interconnection
study results and may be considered withdrawn from the interconnection queue for
failing to meet their tariff-imposed deadlines.139 For these reasons, we find that the
existing pro forma LGIP requirement for transmission providers to make a reasonable
effort to meet interconnection study deadlines contributes to the interconnection study
backlogs, delays, and uncertainty that erects barriers to new generation.140 Therefore, we

137

For example, based on data submitted by transmission providers in compliance

find that the use of a reasonable efforts standard in the existing pro forma LGIP results in
Commission-jurisdictional rates that are unjust and unreasonable.
Third, the pro forma LGIP includes no requirements regarding how or when
transmission providers should complete affected system studies. Without requirements,
affected system studies often lag behind those completed by the transmission provider to
whose transmission system the interconnection customer proposes to interconnect (the
so-called host transmission provider) and are sometimes completed very late in the
interconnection process, causing an additional round of delays and cost uncertainty for
interconnection customers.141 Additionally, for transmission providers that have
procedures for how to complete affected system studies in their tariffs or other documents
(e.g., business practice manuals or joint operating agreements), the procedures are not
consistent, may be hard for interconnection customers to locate, and may not represent
the actual practices in use by the transmission provider, thus still creating uncertainty for
interconnection customers. As a result, we find that the lack of consistent requirements
for affected system modeling and procedures results in Commission-jurisdictional rates
that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential.
Fourth, we find that the Commission’s pro forma LGIP fails to accommodate the
operating characteristics and technical capabilities of electric storage resources when it

as “a growing source of delay and cost uncertainty for interconnection customers, both in
terms of just the timelines involved and the difficulty in pinning those down”).

comes to specific interconnection procedures and modeling. As stated above, the
interconnection queues predominantly consist of new technologies which have operating
characteristics that differ from synchronous resources and were not anticipated when the
Commission established the pro forma generator interconnection procedures and
agreements in Order Nos. 2003 and 2006. Specifically, electric storage resources can be
charged and dispatched on a flexible, as-available basis, and are less likely than
synchronous generating facilities to withdraw energy from the transmission system
during peak load conditions or discharge during light load conditions.142 However, the
existing pro forma generator interconnection procedures and agreements do not
contemplate these operating characteristics or technical capabilities of electric storage
resources. As a result, we find that electric storage resources (whether standalone, colocated generating facilities, or part of a hybrid generating facility), may be studied under
inappropriate operating assumptions (e.g., charging at full capacity during peak load
conditions) that result in assigning unnecessary network upgrades and increased costs to
interconnection customers. Therefore, we find that the Commission’s pro forma LGIP’s
lack of ability to modify operating assumptions for electric storage resources results in

142

See, e.g., Bonneville Initial Comments at 22-23 (stating that “storage resources
are less likely to charge during peak load conditions or discharge during light load
conditions, and . . . those considerations can be factored into assumptions used in
interconnection studies”); NARUC Initial Comments at 37 (stating that “assuming that an
energy storage device will withdraw energy during peak demand . . . fails to recognize
that those resources are likely to be highly responsive to price signals from the
transmission provider and can improve reliability”).

Commission-jurisdictional rates that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory
or preferential.
Additionally, the record supports a finding that the existing pro forma
interconnection procedures regarding material modifications do not provide for consistent
evaluation of technology additions to an existing interconnection request.143 We find that
the record demonstrates that automatically deeming a request to add a generating facility
to an existing interconnection request to be a material modification creates a significant
barrier to access to the transmission system.144 As a result, we find the existing
pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA results in Commission-jurisdictional rates that are
unjust and unreasonable.
Finally, the record supports a finding that the Commission’s pro forma LGIP and
pro forma SGIP fail to require the consideration of alternative transmission technologies
that can be deployed more quickly to be used as network upgrades in place of, and at a
lower cost than, traditional network upgrades.145 In addition, commenters contend that
some alternative transmission technologies could provide substantial benefits by

existing transmission system, improving reliability, and reducing interconnection request
withdrawals, restudies, and overall interconnection delays.146 We find that failing to
require transmission providers to evaluate the list of alternative transmission technologies
enumerated in this final rule results in interconnection customers paying more than is just
and reasonable to reliably interconnect new generating facilities, resulting in
Commission-jurisdictional rates that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory
or preferential. Because the benefits of the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies identified above are present across all interconnection processes, regardless
of the size of the interconnection request, we find that the failure to evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies results in both the pro forma LGIP and
pro forma SGIP being unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential.

See, e.g., AEE Initial Comments at 42 (stating that alternative transmission

Fifth, we find that the Commission’s existing pro forma LGIP and pro forma
SGIP do not include a modeling requirement for non-synchronous generating facilities,
which is necessary to enable the transmission provider to assess and model the facility’s
ability to respond appropriately to transmission system disturbances. These modeling
requirements include: (1) a validated, user-defined root mean square (RMS) positive
sequence dynamic model; (2) an appropriately parameterized, generic library RMS
positive sequence dynamic model; and (3) a validated electromagnetic transient (EMT)
model, if the transmission provider performs an EMT study as part of the interconnection
study process. Additionally, we find that accurate and validated models are necessary to
address study delays and to ensure that transmission providers identify the necessary
interconnection facilities and network upgrades to accommodate the interconnection
request and appropriate assignment of interconnection costs. As a result, we find that the
lack of a modeling requirement for non-synchronous generating facilities in the pro
forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP results in rates that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly
discriminatory or preferential.
Furthermore, the physical characteristics of synchronous generating facilities
allow them to continue to inject electric current during transmission system disturbances,
as required by the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA. 147 However, non-synchronous
generating facilities do not face a comparable requirement and many cease injecting

147

Pro forma LGIA art. 9.7.3 and pro forma SGIA art. 1.5.7 require synchronous
generating facilities to remain “connected to and synchronized with” the transmission
system during system disturbances.

- 54 -

current through “momentary cessation,” which creates reliability issues on the
transmission system.148 Moreover, without requirements for non-synchronous generating
facilities to remain connected to and synchronized with the transmission system,
interconnection studies may not accurately model expected behavior and identify the
appropriate interconnection facilities and network upgrades to accommodate the
interconnection request, skewing the assignment of interconnection costs. As a result,
we find that the lack of comparable requirements for non-synchronous generating
facilities to remain “connected to and synchronized with the [t]ransmission [s]ystem” in
the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA results in rates that are unjust, unreasonable,
and unduly discriminatory or preferential.
In response to commenters that express broad opposition to the need for reform,
we disagree with assertions that the existence of regional variation in interconnection
procedures across the country creates an insufficient legal foundation under FPA section
206 to demonstrate that rates are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or
preferential. Similarly, we disagree with assertions that reforms to the pro forma
generator interconnection procedures and agreements are arbitrary and capricious
because the problems identified herein do not exist uniformly. As an initial matter, the

148

See, e.g., NERC Initial Comments at 9 (stating that “improper planning and
operation of [non-synchronous resources] can pose a significant risk to . . . reliability”
and adding that “risk mitigation measures . . . have been inconsistently adopted by
industry”); MISO TOs Initial Comments at 32-33 (concurring with the Commission that
“with more and more non-synchronous generation facilities entering the interconnection
queue, the lack of a requirement for such resources to respond to system disturbances
becomes ‘more consequential’”).

“Commission may rely on ‘generic’ or ‘general’ findings of a systemic problem to
support imposition of an industry-wide solution.”149 That some interconnection
processes may fare better in the face of industry-wide challenges would be “as
unastonishing as it is irrelevant.”150 The Commission may reasonably rely on rulemaking
to address the systemic drivers leading to widespread interconnection queue backlogs and
delays, notwithstanding regional variation among interconnection procedures.
Moreover, as noted above, every region of the country is seeing an increase in
both interconnection queue size and the length of time interconnection customers are
spending in the interconnection queue prior to commercial operation in recent years.151
Furthermore, the uncertainty and delays in the interconnection queues have resulted in
fewer than 25% of interconnection requests, by capacity, reaching commercial operation
between 2000 and 2017 in any region of the country—with some regions as low as 8%.152
For example, only 10% of interconnection requests, by capacity, have reached
commercial operation in the non-RTO/ISO southeast region between 2000 and 2017.153
Additionally, the challenges being faced across the country will be further compounded

in the future given the recent spikes in interconnection queue sizes. In the non-RTO/ISO
southeast region, the interconnection queue size has more than tripled between 2014 and
2022, with the increase predominantly made up of solar, storage, and hybrid generating
facilities, adding potential complexity to future interconnection queue study processes.154
To the extent existing pro forma interconnection procedures, such as first-come, firstserved study processes, have worked in the past for smaller or less complex queues, such
experience is not indicative of what will be necessary in the future to ensure that a
growing number of interconnection requests are processed in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner.155 Finally, as recognized in Order No. 2003,
interconnection queue delays may “provide[] an unfair advantage to utilities that own
both transmission and generation facilities,”156 making it exceedingly necessary that
interconnection delays are addressed in all regions of the country, especially those where
transmission providers continue to own both transmission and generation.157 As
discussed above, because interconnection queue backlogs and delays afflict generator
interconnection service nationwide, which hinders the timely development of new
generation and thereby stifles competition in the wholesale electric markets, reforms are

necessary to ensure Commission-jurisdictional rates are just, reasonable, and not unduly
discriminatory or preferential.
We are not persuaded by commenters’ concerns that the reforms proposed in the
NOPR, many of which we adopt in this final rule, will be counterproductive in addressing
the need for reform. As discussed in more detail throughout this final rule, we believe
that the reforms adopted herein, as a whole, will improve the efficiency of study
processes, reduce interconnection queue backlogs, and thereby ensure just, reasonable,
and not unduly discriminatory or preferential rates. We believe that, on balance, the
reforms will produce efficiencies by, for example, reducing speculative interconnection
requests and interconnection request withdrawals, which in turn will reduce the time and
resources spent in interconnection studies and restudies thereby decreasing
interconnection queue backlogs and delays. Additionally, the majority of the individual
reforms that the Commission proposed in the NOPR and we adopt in this final rule have
already been implemented in one or more regions in order to improve the interconnection
process, demonstrating incremental improvements. This final rule uses some of these
individual and incremental improvements as a basis for a broad suite of reforms that, in
their entirety, have not yet been adopted by any region and we believe will ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. In some cases, such as for the
commercial readiness reforms adopted in this final rule, we have significantly modified
the NOPR proposal based on comments received.

information, it is difficult for interconnection customers to assess the viability of a

Comments

Several commenters contend that it is a rational response to a lack of preinterconnection queue information for interconnection customers to submit multiple
interconnection requests to gain information on which interconnection sites are favorable
and hedge risks, which leads to withdrawals that exacerbate unmanageable
interconnection queue backlogs.161 ELCON and Environmental Defense Fund argue that
the lack of sufficient information and unexpected cost escalation are the primary reasons
interconnection requests are withdrawn, leading to delays and inefficiencies.162

access to information on potential network upgrades and the cost and time to

be inequitable for the Commission to increase security deposits to stay in the
interconnection queue under the NOPR proposal to increase study and LGIA deposits
without requiring transmission providers to provide sufficient information to
interconnection customers.167 Vistra asserts that the proposals to provide additional
information will complement the exclusive site control proposals and provide an avenue
for prospective interconnection customers to select the most viable sites on which to
obtain rights and develop a location, which is a costly and time-consuming process,
before entering the interconnection queue.168 Northwest and Intermountain argue that, in
order for the other proposed reforms in the NOPR to be effective, potential
interconnection customers must have a solution to the problem of identifying optimal
interconnection locations and configurations that is timely, cost-effective, and accurate.169
Google contends that pre-queue information is necessary because there is an
extreme information asymmetry between independent power producers and transmission

including load growth, relative cost of interconnecting at different points, points of

locations for interconnection more quickly than independent power producers.
On the other hand, Dominion argues that there is no evidence in the record that a
lack of information is slowing down the interconnection queue process or that
transmission providers are not engaged in good faith reviews of interconnection
requests.171 According to Dominion, the Commission should focus on making the
interconnection process more efficient and speedier, and the best way to achieve these
goals is through the first-ready, first-served cluster study reform. While APPA-LPPC
support transparency in the generator interconnection process and share the
Commission’s view that the availability of transmission system information should
reduce the incentive to submit speculative interconnection requests, they argue that
sufficient information is currently publicly available.172

Commission Determination

We find that, absent reforms to require transmission providers to provide
additional interconnection information, which can be used by interconnection customers
prior to submitting an interconnection request, speculative interconnection requests
will likely remain at current levels and continue to contribute to interconnection study
delays and add costs to the interconnection process. Although submitting multiple

pre-interconnection queue information, this practice increases interconnection study
delays.173 We also agree with commenters that additional access to interconnection
information is a valuable goal174 as it can increase the likelihood that an interconnection
request is viable when submitted. We disagree with commenters that current information
requirements are sufficient.175 While certain information is currently available through
the feasibility study process, as part of our reforms discussed below, we eliminate the
feasibility study. Therefore, we find it necessary to provide a means for interconnection
customers to obtain additional information prior to entering the interconnection queue.

entering the interconnection queue is important for interconnection customers to make

Informational Interconnection Study

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the Commission’s pro forma
LGIP to require transmission providers to offer an informational interconnection study
for prospective interconnection customers.178 The Commission proposed that the
informational interconnection study would provide cost estimates for the transmission
provider’s interconnection facilities and network upgrade costs specific to the
interconnection scenario detailed in the study agreement. The Commission also proposed
to include new definitions for an informational interconnection study and informational
interconnection study agreement.

Under the Commission’s proposal, prospective interconnection customers could
request up to five separate informational interconnection studies at a time.179 The
Commission explained that each configuration of an interconnection request would
require a separate informational interconnection study. The Commission proposed that
the informational interconnection study would be at the interconnection customer’s
expense, and each study would require a $10,000 deposit, subject to a true-up based on
actual study costs.
The Commission proposed that, within seven business days of the receipt of a
prospective interconnection customer’s request for an informational interconnection
study, the transmission provider would have to provide the prospective interconnection
customer with an informational interconnection study agreement.180 The Commission
explained that the informational interconnection study agreement would specify the
technical data that the prospective interconnection customer must provide and an estimate
of the expected costs of the study, including, to the extent known by the transmission
provider, an estimate of the study costs expected to be incurred by any relevant affected
systems. Under the proposal, the prospective interconnection customer would have 10
business days to execute the agreement and deliver it to the transmission provider, along
with the relevant technical data and study deposit, after which the transmission provider
would have 45 calendar days to complete the study.

The Commission proposed that the informational interconnection study would
consist of a sensitivity analysis based on the assumptions specified in the informational
interconnection study agreement.181 Under the proposal, the informational
interconnection study would identify potential interconnection facilities and network
upgrades that may be required to interconnect the prospective interconnection customer’s
proposed generating facility, including an approximation of the costs of such
interconnection facilities and network upgrades. The Commission noted that the
transmission provider would also coordinate with affected systems that may be impacted
by the prospective interconnection customer’s request to provide information on affected
systems-related issues.
The Commission proposed an informational interconnection study agreement
form, which explains that the informational interconnection study is performed solely for
informational purposes and is not binding on either party.182 The proposed agreement
also requires the study report to provide specific information, including, at a minimum:
(1) preliminary identification of any circuit breaker short circuit capability limits
exceeded; (2) preliminary identification of any thermal overload or voltage limit
violations; and (3) estimated network upgrade costs related to the identified overloads

The Commission sought comment on: (1) whether the informational
interconnection study, as proposed, would provide prospective interconnection customers
with sufficient and timely information to inform decision-making prior to submitting an
interconnection request; (2) whether transmission providers should be required to
establish a request window of a limited number of days each year in which potential
interconnection customers can request an optional informational interconnection study;
and (3) the burdens on transmission providers of conducting informational studies and
whether other options, such as the proposal discussed below for public interconnection
information, might strike a better balance of providing interconnection customers with
useful information while making efficient use of transmission provider resources.183
Additionally, the Commission proposed to add new section 3.1.2 to the pro forma
LGIP, which provides that interconnection customers evaluating different options (such
as different sizes, sites, or voltages) are encouraged but not required to use the new
informational interconnection study proposed in the NOPR before entering the cluster
study.184

customers.185 Several commenters agree that the informational interconnection study
proposal could reduce the number of speculative or other interconnection requests186 and
improve the efficiency of siting decisions.187 Some commenters expect that these
changes will have other benefits for the interconnection process, including cost savings
from fewer and more viable interconnection requests,188 a reduced need for project
withdrawals and queue restudies,189 and reduced burden on transmission providers, which
will result in fewer interconnection study delays.190
MISO and Fervo Energy state that it is helpful for a prospective interconnection
customer to compare how various MW sizes, points of interconnection, or other scenarios
could affect costs, especially for prospective interconnection customers that cannot
perform such analysis in house, and that the NOPR’s informational interconnection study

proposal would assist in these goals.191 Pacific Northwest Organizations argue that,
without upfront interconnection cost information, independent power producers may be
discouraged from entering the interconnection queue if they are subjected to higher
withdrawal fees, which may result in preventing them from being considered in request
for proposals (RFPs) in the Pacific Northwest.192
Some commenters stress the importance of the informational interconnection
study in light of the other reforms proposed in the NOPR. For instance, Northwest and
Intermountain aver that the informational study will be the primary resource for
interconnection customers to demonstrate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of their
interconnection plan and will serve as the foundation for subsequent negotiations for the
documents that will establish commercial readiness of their project for the cluster study
process.193 Pacific Northwest Organizations assert that the NOPR’s proposed
commercial readiness framework would be problematic in the region without something
like the informational interconnection study to discover costs before entering the
queue.194

informational interconnection study would provide no information related to stabilitydriven network upgrades, rendering it near-useless in areas where stability limits are most
typically the driver of network upgrades.204 APPA-LPPC warn that informational
interconnection studies could engender controversy because prospective interconnection
customers would, notwithstanding the informational nature of the studies, likely rely
upon the study results in making investment decisions, even though the informational
study results would inevitably diverge from the actual interconnection study results.205
Several commenters argue that the proposal is not an improvement over the status
quo.206 National Grid and NextEra assert that it is unclear how the proposal would save
any time compared to the status quo, and that the best way for an interconnection
customer to obtain the necessary information is by entering and proceeding through the
interconnection queue with transmission providers focusing on actual studies.207 NextEra
adds that the proposed informational interconnection study is only informative in extreme
cases, such as very limited capacity available on a transmission line, which the
interconnection customer should be able to identify themselves.208

CREA and NewSun express concern that the NOPR proposal places too much
reliance on the usefulness of the informational interconnection study in order to justify
the financial readiness and commitment NOPR proposals.209 They assert that the
informational interconnection study is not a useful replacement for the feasibility study,
which takes into account the impact of other interconnection customers in the
interconnection queue cluster. Therefore, CREA and NewSun ask the Commission to
instead retain the feasibility study as part of the cluster study process to allow
interconnection customers to obtain cluster-level information on likely costs and network
upgrades before proceeding further with major deposits and irretrievable commitments.

proposed timelines and penalties, the potential amount of informational interconnection

to Vermont Electric and Vermont Transco, even if the informational interconnection
studies envisioned by the NOPR provide interconnection customer benefits, the burdens
of providing informational interconnection studies with cost estimates under the NOPR’s

Commission Determination

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to modify the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to offer an informational interconnection study for prospective
interconnection customers. We are persuaded by commenters’ concerns that requiring an
informational interconnection study could divert the transmission provider’s resources
away from the cluster studies we require in this final rule and undermine the benefits of
those reforms that seek to reduce interconnection study delays, costs, and burden on
constrained engineering labor. Moreover, we agree with commenters that highlight the
various limitations of an informational interconnection study. Notably, an informational
interconnection study, as proposed in the NOPR, would have provided a serial, snapshotin-time analysis on the impact of a single interconnection request, but, in the context of
the subsequent cluster study, the actual impact of an interconnection request within a
larger cluster would reflect different assumptions and differ from the informational
interconnection study, providing minimal or no value to interconnection customers. The
cost estimates that result from such an informational interconnection study would bear
little correspondence to costs determined during a cluster study process and thus provide
minimal value to interconnection customers.
We also find persuasive comments that the informational interconnection study
requirement proposed in the NOPR is not the most effective way to provide

available at no charge). PJM’s proposed section 3.1.2 of the pro forma LGIP would read:
“Interconnection Customers evaluating different options . . . to use the prescreening tool
(Section 6.1 of this LGIP) before entering the Cluster Study.”

interconnection customers with the needed pre-interconnection queue information. At
the same time, we continue to believe that there is a lack of information available to
prospective interconnection customers prior to entering the interconnection queue,
especially given other interconnection customer-related reforms adopted in this final
rule.228 Therefore, as discussed below, we adopt the NOPR proposal to set minimum
requirements for transmission providers to publicly post available information pertaining
to generator interconnection.229 We find that the posting of this information provides a
better balance between the benefits of additional information for prospective
interconnection customers and the burdens on transmission providers.
In response to commenters that support the informational interconnection study
NOPR proposal, below we explain how several of the NOPR proposals that we adopt in
this final rule address their specific concerns. To address commenters’ concerns with the
number of speculative interconnection requests,230 we adopt more stringent site control
requirements and increased commercial readiness deposit requirements,231 which we
believe will better address these concerns than the informational interconnection study
proposal. Additionally, we find that the minimum requirements for transmission

providers to publicly post available information pertaining to generator interconnection232
and the existing requirements in section 2.3 of the pro forma LGIP for transmission
providers to post up-to-date base case study models on their Open Access Same-time
Information System (OASIS) or other password-protected websites will improve the
efficiency of siting decisions233 and will provide interconnection customers with
information about the feasibility of their interconnection plans.234
We are not persuaded that the informational interconnection study proposal would
benefit the interconnection process through: (1) cost savings from fewer, more feasible
interconnection requests;235 (2) a reduced need for interconnection request withdrawals
and restudies;236 and (3) accurate upfront interconnection cost information.237 On the
contrary, the Commission’s adoption of the cluster study reforms in this final rule238
means that the serial nature of the informational interconnection study would fail to

reflect the outcome of the cluster study, and thus would provide minimal, if any, benefits
to interconnection customers.239 We also no longer believe that adopting the
informational interconnection study proposal would reduce burdens on transmission
providers.240 This is because the record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the proposal
would result in additional burdens on transmission providers and would likely cause
transmission providers to divert resources from their cluster study process to conduct
informational interconnection studies,241 thus increasing study delays and costs.
Similarly, we decline CREA and NewSun’s request that the Commission retain the

feasibility study instead of the informational interconnection study. As we discuss below,
the feasibility study was required for the serial study process but is no longer relevant for
the cluster study process.242 We believe that our requirement for transmission providers
to publicly post certain interconnection information will provide interconnection
customers with the information they need prior to entering the interconnection queue, and
therefore decline to adopt CREA and NewSun’s request to maintain the feasibility study.
Because we do not adopt the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
offer an informational interconnection study, we decline to adopt the proposal to add new
section 3.1.2 to the pro forma LGIP to encourage interconnection customers to use the
informational interconnection study.

Public Interconnection Information

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require transmission providers to
maintain and make publicly available an interactive visual representation of available
interconnection capacity (commonly known as a “heatmap”) as well as a table of relevant
interconnection metrics that allow prospective interconnection customers to see certain

estimates of a potential generating facility’s effect on the transmission provider’s
transmission system.243 Specifically, the Commission proposed to revise section 6.4 of
the pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers to post on their public website a
heatmap of estimated incremental injection capacity (in MW) available at each bus in the
transmission provider’s footprint under N-1 conditions, as well as provide a table of
results showing the estimated impact of the addition of a proposed project (based on the
user-specified MW amount, voltage level, and point of interconnection) for each
monitored facility impacted by the proposed project on: (1) the distribution factor;
(2) the MW impact (based on the proposed project size and the distribution factor); (3)
the percentage impact on the monitored facility (based on the MW values of the proposed
project and the monitored facility rating); (4) the percentage of power flow on the
monitored facility before the proposed project; and (5) the percentage power flow on the
monitored facility after the injection of the proposed project. The Commission explained
that these metrics would be calculated based on the power flow model of the cluster study
or restudy with the transfer simulated from each bus to the whole transmission provider’s
footprint (to approximate Network Resource Interconnection Service (NRIS)), and with
the incremental capacity at each bus decremented by the existing and queued generation
in the cluster (based on the existing or requested interconnection service limit of the
generation). The Commission proposed to require transmission providers to update this
information within 30 days after the completion of each cluster study and restudy.

system congestion during the interconnection process.252 Google argues that making
these data publicly available to consumers would allow buyers to make informed choices

argues that greater transparency will increase competition between merchant and utility
developed generating facilities, benefiting consumers.255 Illinois Commission contends
that, if properly implemented, the NOPR proposal will increase the pace at which new
generating facilities can connect to the transmission system, furthering state policy
objectives.256

Several commenters point to the fact that some transmission providers are already
developing such tools as evidence that these tools are unlikely to cause further delays to
stressed interconnection queues or additional burden on transmission providers.260 For
instance, some commenters note that MISO already offers a heatmap that represents
geographically advantageous siting locations.261 Several commenters also note that PJM
is developing such a tool.262 PJM states that in 2023 its queue scope tool will provide a

Several commenters contend that the public information proposal is a more
reasonable balance of costs and benefits relative to the informational interconnection

customers while freeing those resources for additional interconnection studies as
compared to the proposed informational interconnection study.266

not provide sufficient detail273 or commercially actionable information for
interconnection customers.274 Commenters explain that heatmaps are specific to a
moment in time and thus not representative of actual available injection across the
transmission system, which is ever-changing.275 NextEra observes that heatmaps do not
contain actionable information for interconnection and instead focus on energy prices and

representation of interconnection capacity cannot account for all of the conditions
identified in a system impact study, including different system stresses, operability issues
(e.g., N-1-1), stability and voltage issues, and weak transmission system issues.277
Longroad Energy asserts that generator interconnection heatmaps or hosting capacity
maps can be of some use for interconnections to the distribution system but are unlikely
to be beneficial for projects interconnecting at transmission voltages.278
Some commenters do not believe that the heatmap proposal will appreciably
reduce speculative interconnection requests.279 MISO explains that, in its experience,
few interconnection customers use its interconnection heatmap tool and instead tend to
use their own tools.280 Puget Sound states that, even with a heatmap, if an
interconnection customer has a request that would require energy transfer across
balancing authorities, it would have to submit an interconnection request to get
information on the scope of necessary network upgrades.281 NV Energy asserts that a
heatmap of its transmission system would be of little value, appearing as though there is

no available transfer capacity, because the generation in its interconnection queue is more
than five times the level of NV Energy load.282 Meanwhile, Puget Sound states that a
heatmap of its territory would only account for generation and interconnection capacity in
its balancing authority footprint even though its transmission goes beyond this
footprint.283
Several commenters contend that a heatmap tool as proposed would be less useful
in a cluster study than it is in a serial process because it cannot include similarly queued
generation.284 Ohio Commission Consumer Advocate questions whether it will capture
the “dynamic elements” of cluster studies and restudies.285 PacifiCorp and AEP state that
the mere fact that an area is not shown as congested on a heatmap does not mean that it
will be a suitable interconnection location, particularly if multiple interconnection
customers seek to interconnect there.286

not be restricted to prospective interconnection customers and could instead be used by

third-party consultants for their own business interests; for instance, real estate
speculators could use the information to secure exclusive site control for locations that
show significant generator interconnection capacity.287 According to Longroad Energy,
such risk is particularly harmful to wind and solar generation interconnection customers’
needs for large tracts of land to accommodate their generation equipment.288
Some commenters assert that maintaining the heatmap and posting required
information on available interconnection capacity would be burdensome for transmission
providers, especially in non-RTO/ISO regions.289 Similarly, NV Energy states that it
participates in the CAISO energy imbalance market and its energy management system
does not currently have the technical functionality to build an interactive map that shows
information like the available interconnection capacity.290 Some commenters argue that
the heatmaps may provide insufficient benefit to justify cost, resources, and time it would
take to produce them.291 Omaha Public Power further asserts that interconnection

reliable and consequential studies.292 Pacific Northwest Utilities assert that the
Commission should present additional data regarding the benefits of requiring a heatmap
before mandating their use.293 Clean Energy Associations recommend that the
Commission consider other means of increasing information to prospective
interconnection customers, such as public scoping meetings prior to the prospective
interconnection customers entering the interconnection queue.294
Some commenters express concern that the public information proposal will
impose new costs on ratepayers and market participants.295 WAPA states that, given its
defined appropriations and budgets, it is difficult to create new programs, unlike for larger
investor-owned utilities or RTOs/ISOs.296 Dominion estimates that implementation would
require a large up-front financial commitment, potentially for third-party software and

NV Energy contends that creating such a heatmap showing interconnection capabilities
would require finding an eligible software, an ongoing expense.298
Several commenters speak to the burden of additional staffing needs to provide
public interconnection information. National Grid states that the interactive visual
representation tool, even if contracted from a third party, would require significant time
commitments from numerous personnel with relevant and advanced expertise in
transmission and interconnection engineering.299 Tri-State notes that the Commission has
recognized the lack of available engineers and that imposing a heatmap requirement
would exacerbate the problem.300 Dominion and Duke Southeast Utilities state that any
additional process would require additional financial and personnel resources, and also
burden the same personnel that are already engaged in managing the interconnection
queue.301 El Paso Electric argues that transmission providers should not be required to
allocate human resources from interconnection studies to monthly transmission line
capacity estimates because the staff reallocation could cause interconnection study
backlogs.302 PacifiCorp states that this burden will be particularly onerous to

transmission providers outside RTO/ISO regions, which have comparatively few
transmission staff available.303
Several commenters suggest that interconnection customers, on their own or with
consultants, can perform studies with the available information that would provide
estimates on available capacity similar to that produced under the NOPR proposal.304
PPL states that interconnection customers can make their own such maps using
transmission planning models the Commission makes available following a Freedom of
Information Act request.305 APPA-LPPC argue that the Commission fails to establish
that the information already available to prospective interconnection customers under the
existing pro forma LGIP, along with the substantial supplement implemented with Order
No. 845, is inadequate.306 SoCal Edison states that the information included in the NOPR
proposal and more is already available if interconnection customers request it from the
Commission for their own studies or use studies developed by transmission providers.307

depends largely on the location and geography of the resources, which is publicly
available from national labs and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.308
Several commenters state that sufficient data are already required to be posted on
OASIS.309 According to Idaho Power, Order No. 2003-A required interconnection study
reports to be publicly available and provide locational and cost information for previously
studied interconnections, but this has not reduced the amount of interconnection requests
at congested locations.310 SoCal Edison and NYISO state that this information is already
available in FERC Form 715, where it is protected with a non-disclosure agreement as
critical energy infrastructure information (CEII) and has the benefit of being available in
one centralized location.311 On the other hand, ACE-NY disagrees with the assertion that
FERC Form 715 provides sufficient information for interconnection customers to do their
own analysis, asserting that the FERC Form 715 database base cases do not contain
sufficient data about the generation interconnection queue and study assumptions and are
therefore inadequate.312 Rather, ACE-NY argues that more detailed base cases such as
those currently being made available by MISO and PJM, should be required.

Several commenters state that the usefulness of public interconnection information
proposal will depend on the implementation details.313 For example, Illinois Commission
and CESA recognize that the accuracy of the heatmaps is an important part of how useful
they will be.314 Puget Sound states that it has considered creating such a heatmap but has
concerns about its effectiveness given implementation challenges.315 SPP states that
technology, information, and tools are quickly evolving and that a standardization tool
might be obsolete before it is implemented.316 CESA explains that currently CAISO
provides static, snapshot-in-time transmission capability estimates that are helpful but do
not capture locational granularity or other projects already in the interconnection queue,
making it difficult to make an informed project siting decision and at times requiring data

Metrics

While some commenters agree with the Commission’s proposed table of
metrics,320 multiple commenters suggest additional metrics that should be posted.321 For
instance, Public Interest Organizations request information on the available
interconnection capacity (including, at a minimum, a snapshot of existing available
interconnection capacity and associated transmission during high load conditions for each
substation) including projects already in the interconnection queue, and the capacity those
projects are requesting,322 as well as metrics on whether power flows from a point of
interconnection are likely to serve low income and people of color communities (which
would be consistent with Executive Order 13985).323 Other commenters suggest that the

a given point of interconnection, including: the number of generating facilities and
power control devices (including series compensation systems, static synchronous
compensator devices and other power control devices) that are two busses away from the
given point of interconnection; the circuit breaker short circuit ratings of the nearest
substation; and the maximum and minimum fault current in megavolt amperes (MVA) at
the given point of interconnection.340
Several commenters highlight that additional information regarding transmission
system conditions, such as previous cluster studies and models, posted in a secure way
subject to CEII processes, would allow interconnection customers to conduct their own
initial analyses of system conditions and desirable points of interconnection.341 SoCal
Edison states that, alternatively, the transmission providers could identify areas where
new generation is desired, guided by state processes identifying the locations that can
accommodate additional generation currently or locations intended for types of
generation sought state policy.342

Some commenters oppose these requests for additional metrics. Dominion notes
that tracking and providing the information requested by Public Interest Organizations,
including documenting the study process, providing enhanced interconnection queue
tracking, and metrics on constraints that cause bottlenecks, would be burdensome, taking
engineers’ time, slowing down the cluster study process, and diverting resources.343 EEI
and WIRES contend that certain information on transmission line design, such as circuit
type, conductor type, and pole type, would be overly burdensome and offer little benefit,
adding that this information could invite potential disputes or be used to threaten to the
reliability of the transmission system or for commercial gain if the information is not
subject to confidentiality protections.344 EEI also asserts that any additional information
beyond that proposed in the NOPR would complicate the interconnection process by
adding another potential area of dispute and risks potential “backseat driving” by the
interconnection customer, while the transmission provider is responsible for performing
and standing by its study results.345
Some commenters disagree as to the appropriate level of granularity of the
required metrics. SEIA and ENGIE support the NOPR proposal to require transmission
providers to post bus-level interconnection capacity constraints.346 Dominion disagrees,

arguing that requiring capacity constraint information to be provided at the bus-level is
outside the scope of the NOPR and would not necessarily be useful in a networked
system where injection at one bus will affect the capability at other buses and significant
additional power flow analysis would be required to determine these values at each
bus.347 According to Dominion, information about bus-level interconnection capacity
constraints makes more sense where the system is radial in nature and injection capability
at one bus is not dependent on contingencies or injections at another bus. Eversource
adds that bus level information will not provide significant benefits because it may be too
simplistic if it is not based on N-1 conditions or if it fails to incorporate stability
considerations.348 Public Interest Organizations state that many utilities provide hosting
capacity information on their websites at the distribution level in heatmaps or tables, in
particular to help distributed solar interconnection customers, and this information is
required by states and updated regularly.349 Public Interest Organizations ask the
Commission to require analogous hosting capacity information to be provided by
transmission providers for all potential generation locations with exemptions for urban
substations where there is limited potential for generation development. PJM requests

that, rather than requiring that all buses be made available in a large RTO/ISO, a
transmission provider should be allowed to screen and only present the majority of the
feasible points of interconnection.350 As an alternative to providing information at every
bus, Tri-State states that a transmission provider could post the most recent cluster study
to provide information for the buses that were studied as opposed to studying all buses on
the system, while also making clear that the heatmap does not reflect interconnection
requests in neighboring systems.351 Similarly, Bonneville argues that cluster studies
would not provide the incremental injection capacity at each bus on the transmission
provider’s system, which would warrant a separate study, and therefore, transmission
providers should be afforded flexibility to provide this capacity information as it becomes
available.352
Some commenters argue that the proposed heatmap is not an ideal way to present
public interconnection information. For instance, Illinois Commission states that it is not
immediately evident what information maps posted to an RTO/ISO website would
reflect.353 For example, Illinois Commission questions whether congestion maps would
reflect present congestion or congestion that might arise after generating facilities
interconnect. Fervo Energy states that additional research might be needed to determine

the most useful informational suite.354 Clean Energy Associations proposes, and SEIA
supports, that two maps, one for Energy Resource Interconnection Service (ERIS) and
one for capacity or NRIS, should be made available where appropriate, and notes that in
ISO-NE overlapping impact analysis is used to determine eligibility for capacity NRIS.355
Finally, Clean Energy Associations and ISO-NE recommend that the Commission
consider allowing information to be qualitative, such that, rather than a “hosting map,”
transmission providers could post a map and accompanying report regarding system
conditions at various points on the transmission system.356

Security of Critical Information

Several commenters express concern that the NOPR’s proposed heatmap and/or
metrics may create a security risk357 by, among other things, indicating areas where
transmission is heavily loaded and more vulnerable to interference.358 In particular,

impact, which they believe could identify highly stressed transmission lines, as well as
concerns with identifying the line locations, which are not currently provided publicly.359
LADWP further expresses concern with CEII issues that may arise from publicly
releasing a table of metrics regarding the estimated impact of a potential generating
facility.360
Other commenters counter that the security risks associated with the NOPR
proposal are reasonable or non-existent. For example, Pacific Northwest Utilities and
Puget Sound states that the purpose of the heatmap is to provide an overview of
interconnection capacity, which is unlikely to implicate CEII, and thus the risk of
unrestricted critical infrastructure information should be low.361 Indicated PJM TOs and
PPL state that a visual map with limited information, excluding reliability constraints or
other particular information that could be used to identify vulnerabilities, could be made
public without security concerns and highlight PJM as a good example of this.362 Xcel

but that some of the more detailed information should be limited.363 MISO states that it
is currently unaware of any security concerns associated with the proposal.364
While SoCal Edison and Southern assert that there should be no requirement on
transmission providers to make public or display any CEII or confidential information,365
other commenters contend that the CEII label should not be used to unreasonably impede
interconnection customers’ access to interconnection information necessary to understand
the cost and other impacts of locating their projects in different areas of the transmission
system.366 Some commenters recommend that the Commission require transmission
providers to make CEII data available only to interconnection customers who meet
restricted access requirements, such as through a secure portal or subject to a
confidentiality agreement.367 Pattern Energy asks that this information be made available
through a cost-free process that takes no longer than two weeks,368 and Pine Gate adds

States add that the Commission may want to limit access to permitted users, controlling
the copying and dissemination of data, or take other security measures.371

Miscellaneous

SEIA requests that the Commission require transmission providers to use the most

in creating their data results.372
A few commenters express concern with the proposal to require updated
information 30 days after the completion of each cluster study and restudy and instead
request that the Commission allow for regional flexibility on the timing of updates.373
MISO states that, as written, the NOPR proposal would require it to update the tool
available to help interconnection customers pre-screen for potential points of
interconnection each time a regional system impact study is issued, which would be
numerous times during a calendar year due to the configuration of MISO’s transmission

system.374 PJM states that it is not feasible for an RTO/ISO as large as PJM to update an
interactive public interconnection information tool within 30 days after completing a
cluster restudy.375 PJM states that, once the tool includes light load results, it will be
uploading four to six datasets a year with each dataset including millions of points of
interconnection flowgate records, which may eventually not be feasible to maintain from
a storage perspective. According to El Paso Electric, the interconnection queue changes
often as interconnection customers withdraw their requests and therefore transmission
providers should not be required to update capacity line estimates monthly because the
burden on staff could increase interconnection study delays.376 Tri-State explains that
only a subset of buses and lines are studied in each cluster study, so to require an estimate
of the injection capacity at every bus in each cluster study to be posted within 30 days
would greatly increase the scope and cost and would likely have a negative impact on the
time to complete the study and cause rates to increase.377
On the other hand, Ørsted notes that any system representation needs to be
frequently updated to be useful and avoid the risk of becoming out-of-date,378 and Public

that interconnection customers using that information are informed of generating

Requests for Flexibility

Several commenters request flexibility from the Commission with respect to the
particular information included in a potential heatmap.381 Dominion asserts that the
proposal is overly prescriptive and that the Commission should focus on the goal itself
rather than uniformity.382 Clean Energy Associations state that the heatmaps may need to
be tailored to the services offered by a particular transmission provider, because their
services are not uniform.383 Several commenters claim that flexibility will help ensure
that the information provided is useful and understandable, and will place a reasonable
level of burden on transmission providers.384 MISO states that flexibility is reasonable

given the burden on transmission providers of maintaining a heatmap tool relative to the
limited value of frequent updates given that few interconnection customers use this tool
and its inability to include future queued projects that will be relevant to the prospective
interconnection customer.385 Bonneville also argues that flexibility is needed to ensure
consistency with security requirements.386 On the other hand, Cypress Creek asserts that,
as a broad consideration, the particular types of information to be made transparent that
are valuable should be determined by the Commission in consultation with market
participants who are best positioned to identify information relevant to financing and
constructing new projects.387
Several commenters ask for flexibility in the way information is shared. SEIA
states that whether the data are in a map or other format is not as important as the product
itself.388 NYTOs expect that flexibility would allow regions to adopt some form of the

subject to change.389 NRECA states that smaller generation and transmission

cooperatives may be able to just post a table with bus names and injection capability and
present the same useful information in a more economical way.390 NV Energy states that,
if it were to post to its OASIS the CAISO locational marginal price map with a link to
CAISO’s OASIS to provide a list of interchange limits and interchange schedules, this
would be just as valuable as a map for its own transmission system.391
Some commenters argue that transmission providers that already provide public
interconnection information should have flexibility to use their existing systems to
comply.392 However, Environmental Defense Fund avers that this flexibility should not
extend to transmission providers who, prior to the NOPR, were without a substantial
public interconnection information system, because they have no sunk costs related to
public interconnection information systems.393
Several commenters express concern that heatmaps would be technically difficult
to implement outside of RTOs/ISOs and ask the Commission to provide non-RTO/ISO
regions with flexibility in how they comply with the mapping tool.394 Tri-State states

that, in non-RTO/ISO regions, it is common for multiple transmission providers to use a
single substation, making injection capacity dependent on interconnection requests in
neighboring interconnection queues and their associated study assumptions.395 Tri-State,
therefore, encourages the Commission to permit variations among heatmaps, adding that
entities in non-RTOs/ISOs should not be required to study every bus.396
Xcel recommends that the Commission consider applying the requirement only in
RTO/ISO regions or granting non-RTO/ISO transmission providers sufficient time, such
as two years, to comply.397 WAPA asks the Commission to first require data
visualization by larger utilities, wait approximately 18 months after implementation, and
then measure the benefits of interactive tools produced by larger utilities, giving
stakeholders a chance to comment before extending the heatmap requirement.398
On the other hand, some commenters expressly argue that uniformity should be
required inside and outside of RTO/ISO regions.399 Google states that such publicly
available information would begin to address the critical information advantage that
transmission owners have over independent power producers, particularly in non-

Several commenters request clarification on how the public information proposal

$5,000 application fee to cover the significant heatmap costs.411
AEP, Tesla, and ACORE ask the Commission to initiate a proceeding and hold a
technical conference to, among other things, identify useful information tools that could
be feasibly developed, establish uniform and transparent study assumptions, share best
practices, and help less sophisticated interconnection customers learn to use available
tools and information to lessen their own risk before entering an interconnection queue.412

Commission Determination

We adopt, without modification, the NOPR proposal to revise pro forma LGIP
section 6.4, now section 6.1, to require transmission providers to publicly post available
information pertaining to generator interconnection (i.e., public interconnection
information or a heatmap). We require transmission providers to update the heatmap
within 30 calendar days after the completion of each cluster study and cluster restudy.
Such heatmaps must be calculated under N-1 conditions and studied based on the power
flow model of the transmission system with the transfer simulated from each point of
interconnection to the whole transmission provider’s footprint (to approximate NRIS),
and with the incremental capacity at each point of interconnection decremented by the

existing and queued generation at that location (based on the existing or requested
interconnection service limit of such generation). We require transmission providers to
provide the following information as outputs at each point of interconnection: (1) the
distribution factor; (2) the MW impact (based on the proposed project size and the
distribution factor); (3) the percentage impact on each impacted transmission facility
(based on the MW values of the proposed project and the facility rating); (4) the
percentage of power flow on each impacted transmission facility before the proposed
project; and (5) the percentage power flow on each impacted transmission facility after
the injection of the proposed project.
We find that the benefit of providing further transparency to interconnection
customers about potential points of interconnection outweighs the added administrative
burden to transmission providers. Commenters generally support supplementing the
existing publicly available interconnection information and note their broad support for
the NOPR proposal.413 Many commenters further assert that the heatmap will provide

valuable information to interconnection customers before they enter the interconnection
queue,414 and as SEIA explains, interconnection customers currently lack substantial
information prior to entering the interconnection queue, which is valuable in determining
whether to proceed with a proposed generating facility.415 In particular, the information
that we require transmission providers to provide to prospective interconnection
customers will allow such interconnection customers to learn about available
interconnection capacity as well as other metrics that reflect the impact of the addition of
a proposed generating facility to the transmission provider’s transmission system at a
particular point of interconnection. Such information may allow a prospective
interconnection customer to estimate expected congestion,416 and, in turn, to assess likely

network upgrades triggered by a proposed generating facility or the possibility of
curtailment of a proposed generating facility.
With access to this type of information, a prospective interconnection customer
will be able to better assess the viability of a proposed generating facility before it
submits an interconnection request and therefore may be able to submit fewer exploratory
and unviable interconnection requests. We believe that, by reducing the number of
speculative interconnection requests, this reform will reduce the delays caused by
restudies triggered by interconnection request withdrawals and overcrowded
interconnection queues.417 We believe that this information is also beneficial in the
cluster study context, contrary to some commenters’ concerns regarding the availability
of information about the composition of the cluster and the effect of the other proposed
generating facilities in the cluster. In fact, interconnection customers will be able to
evaluate the viability of their proposed generating facility in the context of a cluster by
using the publicly posted information as a baseline and incorporating the cluster
information that transmission providers are required to post, during the customer
engagement window, per new pro forma LGIP section 3.4.5 (Customer Engagement

Window). Further, the heatmap requirement will standardize the information available to
interconnection customers across regions and such standardization will provide
interconnection customers with consistency as they assess the viability of proposed
generating facilities, including where to site them, across regions.418 Despite MISO’s
assertion that interconnection customers typically use their own tools to conduct analyses,
as opposed to MISO’s heatmap, several commenters identify MISO’s heatmap tool as an
example of a transmission provider posting generator interconnection information that is
useful for prospective interconnection customers.419 Therefore, we continue to find that it
is important to make similar information available to prospective interconnection
customers across the country to ensure comparable access to information and the above
mentioned resultant benefits of such information for the interconnection process.

Some commenters assert that the NOPR proposal is not useful420 in part because it
does not provide sufficient detail and may not correspond with future study conditions,421
its usefulness depends on its implementation,422 and it is unlikely to address cost
uncertainty challenges.423 In response to such objections, we find that the public
interconnection information requirements we adopt in this final rule will provide further
transparency of interconnection conditions, but, as we have acknowledged above, will
remain non-binding and therefore cannot provide cost certainty. We recognize that this
requirement does not provide real-time transmission system information, but we find that
this information is valuable to prospective interconnection customers before they enter
the interconnection queue.
We disagree with commenters that assert that the NOPR proposal is overly
burdensome.424 By moving the pro forma LGIP from a serial to a cluster study process,

the reforms adopted in this final rule will reduce the number of studies and restudies
performed by transmission providers, therefore reducing the burden on both transmission
providers and their staff. In addition, as commenters assert, and we agree, the
information posting and interactive capability we require in this final rule could feasibly
be implemented with available industry system simulation tools.425 We also agree with
Clean Energy Associations that providing these data in a standardized format should be a
“relatively low-impact” requirement for transmission providers.426 This appears to be
consistent with comments from Dominion that suggests that the majority of the burden
associated with complying with this reform will be through an up-front financial
commitment in new software, rather than ongoing costs.427 Having made such software
commitments, though, transmission providers should be able to automate much of the
heatmap development, without significant commitments of staff or resources. In doing
so, we expect the ongoing costs of maintaining such a heatmap to be relatively low.
Moreover, because transmission providers must use the most recent cluster study or

cluster restudy to populate the heatmap, they will not face the burden of individualized
analyses, which addresses the concern raised by some commenters.428
We adopt the requirement for transmission providers to update the heatmaps
within 30 calendar days after the completion of each cluster study and cluster restudy.
We recognize the need to balance the burden of a specific update frequency with the
value of ensuring uniform, up-to-date information that can inform prospective
interconnection customers evaluating whether to enter the next cluster. While some
commenters support the timeline proposed in the NOPR,429 others argue that it is overly
burdensome or, given the division of their footprint into regions that have different
timelines, would trigger frequent updates. We find that the requirements we adopt here
establish an appropriate period of time because, as discussed above, once the necessary
software is in place, updating the heatmap after the completion of a study is expected to
be largely automated without significant commitments of staff or resources. As the
record demonstrates, such heatmaps can be implemented with available industry system
simulation tools430 and with a standardized format that causes the burden to be a

“relatively low-impact” requirement for transmission providers,431 once transmission
providers have invested in new software.432
In response to Eversource, which asks the Commission to clarify that the heatmap
would not be required to be made available before the first cluster study concludes,433 we
agree and further clarify that the heatmap would not be required to be made available
until after the transition period. In response to El Paso Electric’s comments regarding the
burden of a monthly update,434 we clarify that the heatmaps must be updated within 30
calendar days after the completion of each cluster study and cluster restudy, not on a
cycle of every 30 calendar days.
In response to comments from PJM, Bonneville, and Tri-State requesting
flexibility for the posting of information for points of interconnection that have yet to be
studied,435 we clarify that transmission providers need to provide updates only for
anything that has changed in the most recent cluster study or restudy after the first cluster
study after the Commission-approved effective date of the transmission provider’s filing

in compliance with this final rule. Requiring transmission providers to study each
potential point of interconnection, rather than just those requested in each cluster, would
expand the scope of this requirement. In turn, requiring such expanded studies would be
inconsistent with ensuring that interconnection customers are able to interconnect in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. In response to PJM, which states that
transmission providers should be allowed to use prescreened datasets that capture a
majority of the feasible points of interconnection that remove existing generator buses on
the low side of the generator step-up unit, rather than using all buses to populate the
heatmap,436 we agree that the heatmap may not differ significantly between the existing
generating facility’s point of interconnection on the low voltage side of the generating
facility’s step-up unit and the high voltage side of the step-up unit. If that is the case, this
final rule provides transmission providers with the flexibility to populate the heatmap
with only the high side of the step-up unit.
In response to comments arguing that the Commission has failed to demonstrate
that information already made available is inadequate,437 we disagree. The heatmap
requirement is distinct from information that transmission providers are already required

to provide. The existing pro forma LGIP requires transmission providers to post the
interconnection models and assumptions on OASIS or a password-protected website. But
the information that we require to be posted in compliance with this final rule is the
output of such models and assumptions. We believe that publicly posting such resulting
output is necessary to aid prospective interconnection customers in their decision-making
prior to entering the interconnection queue. While interconnection customers, on their
own or through the hiring of consultants, may be capable of performing studies with
information already published by transmission providers to arrive at information similar
to that required as part of this final rule, we believe that making high-level information
more easily accessible to all prospective interconnection customers is needed to remedy
unjust and unreasonable Commission-jurisdictional rates. While Order No. 845 and
FERC Form 715 do require certain, more detailed information to be filed with the
Commission and/or posted on OASIS or a password-protected website,438 access to this
information has not addressed the problem of speculative interconnection requests that
we aim to remedy with several reforms adopted in this final rule.
We recognize the need to balance security concerns with the benefits of additional
transparency. While some commenters express security-related concerns with the NOPR
proposal,439 as discussed below, we are not modifying the Commission’s CEII

procedures,440 which we believe are sufficient to address security concerns raised in
comments. Some commenters state that publicly posting information that indicates areas
of transmission congestion or constraints is a risk as these areas are more vulnerable. We
are not persuaded by these concerns and note that location-specific congestion
information is already publicly available in RTO/ISO markets. Moreover, the
Commission’s regulations already provide that, upon request, transmission providers
must make available all data used to calculate available transfer capability, total transfer
capability, capacity benefit margin, and transmission reliability margin for any
constrained posted paths publicly available (including the limiting element(s) and the
cause of the limit (e.g., thermal, voltage, stability)).441 Additionally, we find these
concerns to be speculative, particularly in light of the fact that MISO already provides
similar information over a large area. Rather, we agree with those commenters that do
not believe that the NOPR proposal introduces additional security concerns.442
In response to concerns from PPL and LADWP regarding the distribution factor
analysis being made public,443 we are not persuaded and find these concerns to be
speculative as well. MISO has long made distribution factors publicly available and

states it is currently unaware of any security concerns associated with the proposal.444 As
such, there is no evidence in the record to suggest this posting has raised any concerns in
the past. Moreover, we observe that the distribution factor analyses informing the
heatmaps are the result of multi-year forward projections that inevitably diverge from
actual, real-time conditions, mitigating any potential concerns with publicly posting this
information.
We are similarly unpersuaded by potential data confidentiality concerns.445 As
with distribution factors, we find such concerns to be speculative and contrary to the
experience of MISO, which, for the last several years, has already provided this
information publicly,446 as well as contrary to the statements of commenters that support

We provide further clarification in response to comments regarding the scope of
analysis and assumptions which must provide the basis for the heatmaps. In response to
comments from Public Interest Organizations,448 we decline to specifically require the
heatmap to be studied at high load conditions. Instead, we reiterate that such heatmap
should be based on the power flow model of the cluster study or restudy. While such
cluster studies are often simulated at high load conditions, we understand that
transmission providers typically conduct interconnection studies by studying a variety of
situations. As such, we clarify that the information posted, for consistency and
actionability, must not only be based on the cluster studies, but also must reflect the most
limiting result of each of these situations studied.
We find that it is necessary for the heatmaps to reflect N-1 conditions because
transmission systems are operated to withstand N-1 contingencies. To the extent that
such information was not calculated under N-1 conditions, the results would not be useful
or sufficiently actionable to potential interconnection customers. As Eversource asserts,
point of interconnection level information would be too simplistic if it is based only on
N-0 conditions and would not provide prospective interconnection customers with the
information necessary to select viable points of interconnection.449 Similarly, we find

that it is necessary for such posted information to approximate NRIS because such level
of interconnection service is generally subject to more stringent requirements and
therefore, reflecting this type of service will cover both types of interconnection requests,
whether they are NRIS or ERIS.450 Similar to information calculated under only N-0
conditions, to the extent such a heatmap was not calculated to approximate NRIS, the
results would not be useful or sufficiently actionable to a significant portion of
interconnection customers.
In response to comments from AES,451 we decline to require the heatmaps to
include a five-year outlook of available interconnection capacity. The purpose of the
heatmaps is to provide potential interconnection customers an idea of the amount of
interconnection capacity available at the conclusion of each cluster study or restudy.
Because we are requiring transmission providers to consider pending generating facilities
when collating the information to make public, interconnection customers will be aware

450

Specifically, the pro forma LGIP defines NRIS service as “an Interconnection
Service that allows the Interconnection Customer to integrate its Large Generating Facility
with the Transmission Provider’s Transmission System (1) in a manner comparable to that
in which the Transmission Provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native load
customers; or (2) in an RTO or ISO with market-based congestion management, in the
same manner as Network Resources. Network Resource Interconnection Service in and of
itself does not convey transmission service.” Pro forma LGIP section 1. Whereas, the
pro forma LGIP defines ERIS as “an Interconnection Service that allows the
Interconnection Customer to connect its Generating Facility to the Transmission
Provider’s Transmission System to be eligible to deliver the Generating Facility’s electric
output using the existing firm or nonfirm capacity of the Transmission Provider’s
Transmission System on an as available basis. Energy Resource Interconnection Service
in and of itself does not convey transmission service.” Id. (emphasis added).

of some of the future conditions on the transmission system. Further, any requirement to
produce forecasts would place an additional burden on transmission providers that we
find would outweigh its usefulness to interconnection customers.
In response to comments from Alliant Energy and Clean Energy Associations
arguing that the assumptions used to produce the heatmap should be made clear to
users,452 we find that the assumptions used to produce the heatmap should be consistent
with those used in the interconnection cluster studies. As those assumptions are already
required to be publicly posted, along with the models themselves,453 the assumptions used
to produce the heatmap will be publicly posted via these preexisting requirements.
Tri-State describes difficulties associated with multiple transmission providers that
inhabit a single substation. In such situations, we clarify that transmission providers must
populate the required heatmaps using the results from their interconnection studies. In
response to the Illinois Commission, we clarify that the heatmaps must represent
potential congestion that might result after a generating facility interconnects, not present
congestion values. The heatmap must reflect the base case assumptions from the most
recent cluster study or cluster restudy. Such studies are not intended to analyze current
operational conditions.

We next respond to specific objections raised regarding the heatmaps’ required
level of granularity and scope, requested flexibilities regarding alternatives to the adopted
reform, and clarifications regarding which transmission providers are required to provide
heatmaps, whether heatmaps are non-binding, and how costs related to the heatmaps
requirement are to be recovered. We decline to alter the level of granularity of the
heatmaps from that proposed in the NOPR. As Ameren and MISO attest,454 the five data
points proposed in the NOPR are reasonable and sufficient to provide a high-level
comparison between several points of interconnection, and therefore to satisfy the goals
of this reform.
Similarly, consistent with support from ENGIE and SEIA,455 we adopt the scope
of the heatmap requirement proposed in the NOPR, which is the amount of point of
interconnection-level interconnection capacity available to be injected at each point of
interconnection. We decline to expand the scope of the reporting. We believe that the
scope of information that we require transmission providers to publicly post appropriately
balances the burdens on transmission providers associated with providing this
information with the benefits that might be realized by prospective interconnection
customers of having ready access to this information. In response to Dominion, which
argues that point of interconnection-level information may not necessarily be useful

because, in a networked system, injection at one point of interconnection will affect the
capability at other points of interconnection,456 we agree that injections at one location
affect capabilities at other locations. Because the information provided by the
transmission provider accounts for full transmission system conditions, interconnection
customers should have the information they need to approximate the impact of their
potential generating facility on the transmission system. For example, interconnection
customers will know if they are proposing to interconnect near constrained regions even
if those constraints are not necessarily at the proposed point of interconnection.
We decline to require transmission providers to provide additional interconnection
information metrics, as requested by some commenters.457 While we are supportive of
increased transparency, we are not persuaded that the benefits of such information would
outweigh the burden of tabulating and posting such information.
In response to ISO-NE, we decline to require that the heatmap be qualitative
only.458 We find that providing information only qualitatively would not provide
interconnection customers information they could use to adequately mitigate risks such as

obtaining site control and providing significant deposits to the transmission provider in
order to enter the interconnection queue. Thus, providing only qualitative information
would be insufficient to address the lack of information available to interconnection
customers prior to entering the interconnection queue, which leads to speculative
interconnection requests and the problems identified in the need for reform section above.
In response to requests for flexibility for transmission providers to identify and
post alternative heatmaps,459 we decline to grant such additional flexibility. In this final
rule, we establish a set of required information that transmission providers must publicly
provide. We believe that this level of information is what is needed to address the lack of
information available to interconnection customers prior to entering the interconnection
queue, and therefore remedy the unjust and unreasonable Commission-jurisdictional rates
discussed in Section II of this final rule. We therefore disagree that the proposal is overly
prescriptive,460 as we believe that the required information is necessary to adequately
inform prospective interconnection customers. While we establish a set of required
information, in response to comments from Clean Energy Associations that the heatmap

and comments from Bonneville that flexibility would allow transmission providers to
determine whether a different methodology would more clearly identify interconnection
capability for interconnection customers,462 we note that if transmission providers find
value in providing additional or different information, they may propose such variations
on compliance.
While we acknowledge that, as a result of the relative interconnection queue sizes
and load levels, many transmission providers may have heatmaps that indicate negative
interconnection capacity and thereby would simply be “red,”463 we agree with R Street
that providing a visual representation of available interconnection capacity is a best
practice and should be required nationwide.464 Moreover, we find that there is value in
providing an all “red” heatmap, as such information will demonstrate to prospective
interconnection customers the potential and likely network upgrade-related consequences
associated with interconnecting. In other words, an all “red” heatmap sends a valuable
signal to interconnection customers regarding where proposed generating facilities may
be more or less economic to interconnect prior to entering the interconnection queue.

Not only is there value in requiring this information from all transmission
providers, we are not persuaded that the burden is so great as to outweigh the benefits for
non-RTO/ISO transmission providers and for smaller transmission providers.465 We
acknowledge that RTOs/ISOs are operationally different from their non-RTO/ISO
counterparts and that RTOs/ISOs are often more technologically advanced, but the
requirement is to reproduce interconnection studies and publish the results in a heatmap.
No commenter attests that existing interconnection studies in non-RTO/ISO regions fail
to evaluate point of interconnection-level interconnection injection capability. Moreover,
we find that by publicly reproducing the results of existing interconnection studies, the
heatmaps will address the need for additional interconnection information that exists in
both RTOs/ISOs and non-RTOs/ISOs. In other words, we find that there are unjust and
unreasonable Commission-jurisdictional rates stemming from the lack of this information
for prospective interconnection customers both within and outside of RTOs/ISOs and that
this problem must be remedied. Additionally, as Environmental Defense Fund
comments, at least one other relatively small transmission owner posts an interactive
capacity heatmap for its distribution system comparable to that required by this final

rule.466 Thus, contrary to comments from PPL,467 we find that smaller transmission
providers are able to provide this information to prospective interconnection customers
and that the benefits outweigh the burdens.
In response to comments from the NY Commission and NYSERDA asking for
flexibility to ensure that the information is accessible and understandable,468 we do not
think that such flexibility is needed—we specifically require the information to be
contained within an interactive map and posted on transmission providers’ websites for
this purpose. Contrary to comments from NV Energy,469 we find that the interactive map
is necessary to ensure accessibility and understandability. Absent the map, potential
interconnection customers would need to separately map injection points of
interconnection to specific locations.
In response to comments from PJM and NV Energy requesting flexibility for
transmission providers, in lieu of the heatmap, to post congestion information and a link
to OASIS with interchange limits and schedules, we decline to grant such flexibility. We
find that there are meaningful differences between the results of planning studies, such as
those used in the interconnection process, and operational data, like congestion and

interchange schedules. Interconnection studies are generally conducted at a specific
high-stress point in time for injection at a specific point of interconnection to determine
flows across the whole transmission system, while operational data are simply the
accumulation of real-time and/or day-ahead results. Thus, posting such operational data
would only introduce timing differences and could not substitute for the deliverability
analyses conducted in the interconnection processes.
In response to NYTOs, we clarify that the information displayed in the heatmap
will be illustrative, non-binding, and subject to change.470 We agree with Tri-State’s
statement that transmission providers must also caveat that the results do not account for
affected system impacts. As we have acknowledged, one primary driver of the available
interconnection capacity is the composition of the interconnection customer’s cluster, and
the heatmap cannot reflect those additional interconnection requests prior to the end of
the customer request window.
In response to requests to clarify the funding mechanism associated with the
heatmap requirement,471 we clarify that transmission providers, not interconnection
customers, are responsible for paying for costs associated with posting the relevant
heatmaps required in pro forma LGIP section 6.1. However, we note that, to the extent
such costs are properly recoverable in transmission rates consistent with existing

Commission accounting and ratemaking policy, such rate treatment is appropriate, and
this final rule does not preclude such treatment. We find that this reform will improve
overall interconnection queue efficiency to the benefit of transmission customers,
consistent with Commission policy.472
In response to Dominion, which requests clarification in the RTO/ISO context,473
we clarify that within an RTO/ISO, the heatmap requirement applies to the RTO/ISO,
rather than to an individual transmission owner in an RTO/ISO. Thus, transmission
owners in RTOs/ISOs are not required to separately post their own visual representations
and results.
Finally, in response to concerns from WAPA about federal power marketing
agencies having defined budgets and appropriations,474 we note that transmission
providers may explain specific circumstances on compliance and justify why any
deviations are either “consistent with or superior to” the pro forma LGIP or merit an
independent entity variation in the context of RTOs/ISOs.

Cluster Study Process

Need for Reform and Interconnection Study Procedures
i.

NOPR Proposal

To remedy what may now be an unjust and unreasonable interconnection process,
the Commission proposed to eliminate the serial first-come, first-served study process in
the pro forma LGIP and instead require transmission providers to use a first-ready, firstserved cluster study process.475 The Commission explained that under a first-ready, firstserved cluster study process, transmission providers would perform larger
interconnection studies encompassing numerous proposed generating facilities, rather
than separate studies for each individual interconnection request. Under the NOPR
proposal, transmission providers would perform a single cluster study and cluster restudy
each year, the particulars of which are further discussed below.

perspective, the proposed cluster study process provides more certainty on timing and

Dominion states that another benefit of moving to the proposed cluster study
process is that, if a proposed generating facility is not ready for its cluster study, it can
join the next cluster rather than losing its interconnection queue position as occurs in a
serial study process.482 Dominion asserts that, as a result, the proposed cluster study
process removes the incentive for an interconnection customer to “reserve a spot in line”
for a proposed generating facility is not yet viable. Ohio Commission Consumer

generating facilities would be especially beneficial for interconnection customers with
multiple proposed generating facilities in close geographical proximity.483 Avangrid

believes that applying this concept to more regions will lead to a more guided and
proactive build-out of new generation and required transmission upgrades.484
Several commenters argue that the proposed cluster study process will foster
renewable resource development and aid in meeting national and/or state clean energy
and carbon emissions reduction goals.485 Puget Sound states that over the past year, it
has seen unprecedented numbers of interconnection requests in response to the resource
solicitation process and a demand for new renewable energy sources.486 Puget Sound
adds that it has experienced a backlogged interconnection queue, entry of speculative
interconnection requests, and uncertainty for interconnection customers relying on
higher-queued interconnection requests to complete the interconnection process for their
proposed generating facilities to be feasible. Clean Energy States assert that, because
wind and solar projects can be relatively small, clustering should help smaller projects
share the cost of interconnection studies and upgrades, thereby providing them a viable
path through the interconnection process.487

as it is coupled with additional requirements, some of which the Commission proposed in

the NOPR.488 AEE recommends that the Commission consider further reforms to
harmonize study assumptions and more closely link generator interconnection and longterm regional transmission planning processes.489 R Street states that the Commission
should consider an interconnection study approach that uses transparent, realistic study
assumptions.490 Clean Energy Associations argue that certain conservative
assumptions—such as NERC standard TPL-001’s extreme contingency cases—can lead
to the identification of unreasonably large and costly upgrades.491 Clean Energy
Associations also assert that the Commission should make clear in its final rule whether
moving from a serial study process to a cluster study process should or should not be
accompanied by any change in the interconnection standards and assumptions used in
those studies.492 Ameren generally supports the proposal to move to a first-ready, firstserved cluster study process, but argues that this move without other reforms is unlikely
to clear the interconnection queue backlog.493 NERC states that its support for cluster

studies is predicated on parallel enhancements for model validation with actual installed
equipment and a true-up prior to interconnection.494
Other commenters express some concern with the move to the proposed cluster
study process. For example, Enel states that cluster studies increase interdependence
between interconnection requests, with a greater likelihood that multiple interconnection
customers are responsible for a single network upgrade, which creates a paradigm where
one interconnection customer’s actions, such as withdrawing from the interconnection
queue, can have drastic impacts on many other interconnection customers.495 Enel also
asserts that, while the proposed cluster study process has some benefits, recent cluster
studies are resulting in significant regional transmission constraints with very high
associated network upgrade costs and long construction schedules. Enel contends that
the proposed cluster study process can still reduce interdependency and succeed if there
are much smaller, more local, regional groupings of interconnection requests in cluster
studies and lower minimum impact thresholds for determining network upgrades. Enel
says the Commission should adopt these two practices if it adopts the proposed cluster
study process.
Some commenters note that, where the demand for generator interconnection
significantly exceeds the available supply of interconnection access, the NOPR’s
proposed cluster study process and interconnection queue management reforms alone

may be insufficient to address the backlog of interconnection requests.496 Other
commenters assert that under these circumstances, some form of interconnection request
prioritization may be needed to effectively allocate scarce interconnection access to the
lowest-cost or highest-value proposed generating facilities.497
Several commenters state that, while they support the use of the proposed cluster
study process, the Commission should allow variation among transmission providers in
the makeup of the study process.498 Some commenters argue that regional variations
should be permitted, especially where transmission providers have already implemented a
first-ready, first-served cluster study process.499 Environmental Defense Fund, on the
other hand, argues that the Commission should provide limited flexibility for
transmission providers to demonstrate in their compliance filing that a preexisting cluster

study process is substantially similar to the process established in the Commission’s final
rule.500
Pacific Northwest Utilities and CREA and NewSun urge the Commission to allow
flexibility for transmission providers to design the cluster study process to implement
either a single-phase or two-phase cluster study process.501 Pacific Northwest Utilities
contend that requiring full commercial readiness in a single-phase study process, as
proposed in the NOPR, significantly restricts an interconnection customer’s ability to
enter the interconnection queue.502 Pacific Northwest Utilities argue that a two-phase
approach provides greater accessibility to some interconnection customers by not
requiring commercial readiness for entry into the first phase. According to Pacific
Northwest Utilities, this is because all interconnection customers who have attained site
control will have information about the network upgrades needed to meet the
interconnection requirements of the cluster and the expected cost responsibility for each
interconnection customer in the cluster. Pacific Northwest Utilities aver that this
information reduces the potential for interconnection customers to withdraw from phase
two and, therefore, should reduce the need for additional restudies that might slow or stall
the interconnection process.

Some commenters argue that it may not be appropriate to mandate the proposed
cluster study process for every transmission provider as cluster studies can be complex,
expensive, and not the most efficient or necessary approach for all proposed generating
facilities or circumstances.503 Some commenters generally support the use of cluster
studies if transmission providers retain discretion to use the existing serial study
process.504 Vermont Electric and Vermont Transco notes that not all interconnection
requests need to be studied in a cluster format, and that this has frequently been the
situation in New England, where interconnection queue bottlenecks have historically
been locational and driven by state clean energy procurement efforts.505 ISO-NE requests
that the Commission consider a more targeted approach for clusters triggered by
geographic or electric proximity among interconnection requests, rather than a blanket
clustering process for all interconnection requests.506 Instead of mandating a clustering in
all regions, ISO-NE contends that the Commission consider the expanded use of
clustering in areas with larger concentrations of proposed generating facilities, while

allowing use of serial studies for customers seeking to interconnect in areas with low
activity, where serial studies could proceed relatively quickly.
National Grid asks for clarification as to whether the proposed cluster study
process encompasses energy or capacity interconnection service requests, or both.507
Some commenters contend that the Commission should encourage relevant state
entities to consider the efficient coordination of their state-jurisdictional interconnection
process with Commission-jurisdictional interconnection processes.508 Avangrid argues
that sizable distributed energy resources should be aggregated and included in the broader
cluster study of large and small Commission-jurisdictional generating facilities. Pine
Gate suggests the Commission require transmission providers, on compliance, to
“document how they will ensure that any serial processes for state-jurisdictional
interconnection agreements will interact with the required cluster study process” and
explain how the interconnection queue position of qualifying facilities (QFs) will not be

process, alongside the other reforms adopted in the final rule, will remedy the unjust and
unreasonable rates discussed in Section II of this final rule. Specifically, we believe that
this reform will help remedy the problems of the existing interconnection process for
large generating facilities in several ways. First, the cluster study process will increase
efficiency because transmission providers can perform larger interconnection studies
encompassing many proposed generating facilities, rather than separate studies for each
individual interconnection customer.510 The cluster study process will provide greater
certainty to interconnection customers, regarding both the timing of studies and the
magnitude of network upgrade costs. Coupled with the increased financial commitments
and requirements to enter the interconnection queue, such as a demonstration of site
control, as discussed further below, the cluster study process will also disincentivize
interconnection customers from submitting interconnection requests for speculative
generating facilities and ensure that ready, more viable proposed generating facilities can

proceed through the study process.511 We also expect that the cluster study process will
result in fewer withdrawals because conducting a single cluster study and cluster restudy
will minimize delays that arise from proposed generating facility interdependencies under
the existing serial study process, in which lower-queued interconnection customers can
strategically and monetarily benefit from network upgrades and associated costs borne
earlier in the interconnection process by higher-queued interconnection customers. We
further expect that the cluster study process will minimize the risk of cascading restudies
when an interconnection customer withdraws.512
We are not persuaded by Enel’s request that the Commission adopt smaller, more
local regional groupings of proposed generating facilities in interconnection studies and
lower minimum impact thresholds for determining upgrades.513 We find the record
insufficient to support these additional requirements. We also decline requests to allow
transmission providers to either continue to use a serial study process or to create a
parallel serial study process514 because, as discussed further below, we find that

establishing in the pro forma LGIP a separate interconnection process outside the cluster
study process could detract from transmission providers’ efforts to efficiently process
cluster studies, and would be insufficient to ensure that interconnection customers are
able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and
timely manner.
In response to requests to allow variation in how clusters are formed,515 we
emphasize that the reforms to the pro forma LGIP adopted in this final rule do not
prescribe how transmission providers should form clusters.
In response to National Grid,516 we decline to clarify whether the proposed cluster
study process encompasses energy or capacity interconnection service requests. “Energy
interconnection requests” and “capacity interconnection requests” are not defined terms
in the pro forma LGIP, and we decline to define them here. We do not believe that such
detail is needed for transmission providers to implement the reforms adopted herein.
In response to Avangrid,517 we encourage relevant state entities to consider the
efficient coordination of their state-jurisdictional interconnection processes with
Commission-jurisdictional interconnection processes.

Defined Terms in the Pro Forma LGIP and Pro Forma

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to add several new defined terms (such as
cluster, cluster study process, and cluster request window) and to revise several defined
terms (such as stand alone network upgrade and material modification) in section 1 of the
pro forma LGIP and article 1 of the pro forma LGIA.523
ii.

Comments

Starting with the proposed definition of stand alone network upgrade, a few
commenters support the Commission’s proposal.524 Tri-State suggests adding to the
definition of stand alone network upgrade that a transmission provider’s interconnection
facilities may be shared by more than one generating facility in a given cluster study,
including a co-located resource.525

Other commenters oppose the proposed revisions to the definition of stand alone
network upgrade. Clean Energy Associations argue that the proposal to modify the
definition of stand alone network upgrade to restrict it to those needed only for a single
interconnection customer is problematic and counterproductive.526 Clean Energy
Associations contend that allowing interconnection customers the right to self-build
interconnection facilities and stand alone network upgrades since Order No. 845 has
served as a welcome relief valve to transmission providers’ lengthy construction
timelines, giving customers increased control of both the time and cost for building these
upgrades. As an alternative, Clean Energy Associations suggest an approach similar to
ISO-NE’s for network upgrades that are needed for multiple interconnections where an
independently developed elective network upgrade, if selected by all of the
interconnection customers in the cluster that require the network upgrade, can take the
place of the incumbent-built cluster enabling network upgrade.
Pine Gate states that in its experience, after Order No. 845, transmission providers
have taken a very narrow view of the facilities that constitute stand alone network
upgrades, and thus the potential for interconnection customers to exercise the option to
build has not been fully realized.527 Pine Gate asserts that the proposed change would
further restrict the opportunity for interconnection customers to exercise the option to

build, exacerbate construction delays, and result in a lack of competition to construct
stand alone network upgrades, ultimately harming consumers. Pine Gate therefore
recommends that the Commission not modify the definition of stand alone network
upgrade as proposed and instead grant the interconnection customer with the largest
projected impact on a potential stand alone network upgrade facility the ability to elect
the option to build with priority falling to each interconnection customer based on the
next largest impact on the stand alone network upgrades.
Enel argues that the Commission should not adopt the proposed substantive
revisions to the definition of stand alone network upgrades and should instead expand the
definition of stand alone network upgrades to include upgrades to an existing
transmission facility which involves a transmission line or substation being entirely
rebuilt.528 Enel offers suggestions for implementing a third-party option that would give
interconnection customers more control over the cost and schedule of larger network
upgrades, resolving a frequent barrier to bringing needed generating facilities online. To
that end, Enel states that pro forma LGIA article 5.1 could be modified to specify that the
option to build is only eligible for stand alone network upgrades funded by a single
interconnection customer, while the proposed third-party option could be used for all
stand alone network upgrades, including line and substation rebuilds.

Moving to the proposed definition of material modification, some commenters
support the Commission’s proposal.529 Ørsted urges the Commission to ensure that under
the newly proposed definition of material modification, any changes to a proposed
generating facility that occur on the generating facility side of the point of
interconnection that do not result in changes to the electrical output at the point of
interconnection or the electrical characteristics of the generating facility’s
interconnection: (1) will not be deemed to be a material modification; and (2) will not
result in the termination of the interconnection customer’s queue position.530
Ameren suggests that the Commission consider clarifying the proposed definition
of material modification, so that cost and timing are factors to be considered in addition
to when the transmission provider determines changes to the point of interconnection are
otherwise material (e.g., from an electrical standpoint).531 Ameren states that the
Commission may want to consider whether the change should only be triggered by a
change to the point of interconnection or whether a change to the inverters or other pieces
of equipment in the interconnecting generating facility, which could require other
upgrades, should also result in the determination of a material modification.

EPSA asks the Commission to be clearer in determining a standard definition of a
material modification.532 EPSA argues that, at minimum, the Commission should direct
each RTO/ISO or each NERC region to establish clear criteria for the evaluation of
material modifications.
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed revisions to section 1 of the pro forma LGIP and article 1
of the pro forma LGIA to revise and add several defined terms. Specifically, we adopt
the proposed revisions to the definition of stand alone network upgrade to clarify that, for
a network upgrade to be eligible for treatment as a stand alone network upgrade, the
network upgrade must be required for only one interconnection customer and must meet
the other existing requirements in the definition of stand alone network upgrade. We
address further modifications to the definition of stand alone network upgrade below
where discussing network upgrade cost allocation (Section III.A.4.c of this final rule).
We also adopt the proposed revisions to the definition of material modification, which
account for the equal interconnection queue position of proposed generating facilities that
are part of the same cluster. We also modify the NOPR proposal to define
interconnection facilities study report.
With respect to the definition of stand alone network upgrade, in response to Clean
Energy Associations’ concerns, we note that we do not remove the right to self-build
interconnection facilities and stand alone network upgrades established in Order No. 845.

Rather, we are explicitly maintaining the status quo, which is to say that, under the
existing pro forma LGIP, there is no potential for a stand alone network upgrade to be
shared by more than one interconnection customer. With the revision proposed in the
NOPR and adopted here, we are ensuring that within the structure of a cluster study
process adopted in this final rule, stand alone network upgrades continue to be defined as
only those required for a single interconnection customer, and therefore the option to
build is only available for a single interconnection customer. Were we to not adopt this
revision, multiple interconnection customers could potentially attempt to construct the
same stand alone network upgrades, leading to confusion and potentially lengthy
negotiations and/or disputes regarding which interconnection customer had the right to
construct the stand alone network upgrade. Additionally, with regard to Clean Energy
Associations’ request that the Commission consider an approach similar to ISO-NE’s for
certain upgrades that are needed for multiple interconnections, we decline to adopt this
approach because it is outside the scope of this proceeding. We are not proposing in this
proceeding to modify the pro forma LGIP to address the cost responsibility and division
of work between interconnection customers that may share cost allocation for stand alone
network upgrades.
Similarly, Tri-State, Pine Gate, and Enel argue that the Commission should
expand the definition of stand alone network upgrade, thereby expanding the right of
interconnection customers to build certain network upgrades. These requests are outside
the scope of this proceeding, which is not proposing to modify the scope of
interconnection customers’ option to build certain stand alone network upgrades but

rather is only revising definitions insofar as is necessary to implement reforms adopted
elsewhere in this final rule. For the same reason, we decline to expand the definition of
material modification, as Ørsted, Ameren, and EPSA request.533
c.

Definitive Point of Interconnection
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to add new section 3.1.2 to the pro forma
LGIP and therein to require interconnection customers to select a definitive point of
interconnection to be studied no later than the execution of the cluster study agreement.
The Commission also proposed that, upon mutual agreement, the transmission provider
may make reasonable changes to the requested point of interconnection to facilitate
efficient generator interconnection of clustered interconnection requests at common
points of interconnection.534
ii.

Comments

MISO supports the Commission requiring the selection of a definitive point of
interconnection when executing the cluster study agreement; however, MISO encourages
the Commission to require the selection of a definitive point of interconnection even
earlier, as part of the interconnection request.535 MISO notes that requiring an earlier

selection of the definitive point of interconnection will assist in interconnection queue
processing, as a transmission provider would not be able to begin modeling work if the
interconnection customer is permitted to wait until a later point in time to select its
definitive point of interconnection. MISO further argues that the definitive point of
interconnection (even if subject to change) should be selected prior to any scoping
meeting. MISO also supports the proposed language that limits the ability of the
interconnection customer to change its point of interconnection after the submission of
interconnection request.
Other commenters do not support the Commission’s proposal to require a
definitive point of interconnection when executing the cluster study agreement.536
ACE-NY supports making the demonstration of a feasible point of interconnection a
requirement for a generating facility to move into the facilities study phase of the
generator interconnection process.537
Pine Gate and CREA and NewSun assert that the Commission should modify its
proposal to permit interconnection customers to request alternative points of
interconnection.538 Pine Gate argues that the Commission should permit interconnection
customers to request a study of a primary and secondary point of interconnection within

one or two electrical buses, then select a point of interconnection restudy after receiving
initial cluster study results.539 Similarly, CREA and NewSun assert that the Commission
should permit alternative points of interconnection, and collective points of
interconnection for proposed generating facilities in a cluster (e.g., those that could
connect to a single substation), to be proposed and studied, at least through the system
impact study in order to obtain more complete cost information.540
Enel suggests that, in the second paragraph of proposed section 3.1.2 of the
pro forma LGIP, the Commission should change the word “make” to “propose” in the
following quoted language: “For purposes of clustering Interconnection Requests,
Transmission Provider may make reasonable changes to the requested Point of
Interconnection.”541 Enel explains that this would clarify that any such changes can only
be made with the consent of the interconnection customer, as specified in the proposed
new final sentence to that paragraph.

Requiring interconnection customers to select a definitive point of interconnection
when executing the cluster study agreement allows the interconnection customer to
submit its interconnection request with a proposed point of interconnection, participate in
the scoping meeting during the customer engagement window, and receive feedback on
its proposed point of interconnection. We believe that this strikes the right balance
between allowing for flexibility and potential adjustments to the point of interconnection,
based on discussion with the transmission provider and the transmission provider’s
detailed knowledge of its transmission system, and providing transmission providers with
the information necessary to conduct the cluster study, thus reducing the potential for
restudies that would be required if interconnection customers could change their points of
interconnection later in the process.
We decline to: (1) require that the definitive point of interconnection be selected
earlier (e.g., as part of the interconnection request);542 (2) only require that the definitive
point of interconnection be selected later (e.g., at the facilities study phase);543 or (3)
permit interconnection customers to submit multiple alternative points of interconnection
for study in a single interconnection request.544 We believe that requiring the selection of

MISO, would deprive interconnection customers of information that could aid in their
selection. Similarly, we believe that requiring the selection of a definitive point of
interconnection after the cluster study, as suggested by ACE-NY, or allowing multiple
points of interconnection to be studied before the interconnection customer is required to
select the definitive point of interconnection, as suggested by Pine Gate and CREA and
NewSun, fails to take into account the fact that, if an interconnection customer changes
the definitive point of interconnection after the cluster study, it will likely impact the
study results of the other interconnection customers in the cluster and could lead to
restudies and delays. We do not believe that the alternatives suggested by commenters
would remedy the unjust and unreasonable status quo described in Section II of this final
rule.
Finally, we agree with Enel’s suggestion to change the word “make” to “propose”
in pro forma LGIP section 3.1.2. We modify that section to state: “For purposes of
clustering Interconnection Requests, Transmission Provider may propose reasonable
changes to the requested Point of Interconnection.”545 We agree that this clarifies that
any such changes can only be made with the consent of the interconnection customer.

Window
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to add new section 3.4.1 (Cluster Request
Window) to the pro forma LGIP to require interconnection customers to submit an
interconnection request during the cluster request window—a 45-calendar day period
with the start date to be determined by each transmission provider (with the annual start
date for the transmission provider’s cluster request window included in its LGIP).546 The
transmission provider would consider all interconnection requests accepted during this
period to have equal queue priority for purposes of the cluster study. The Commission
also proposed to add in pro forma LGIP section 3.1.1 (Initial Study Deposit) a nonrefundable application fee of $5,000 to be submitted with the interconnection request.
The Commission further proposed that interconnection customers must cure deficient
interconnection requests within 10 business days after receipt of notice from the
transmission provider, but no later than the close of the cluster request window.
The Commission also proposed to add new pro forma LGIP section 3.4.5
(Customer Engagement Window), which provides that, following the close of the cluster
request window, the transmission provider begins a 30-calendar day customer
engagement window.547 New pro forma LGIP section 3.4.5 also requires the

Clean Energy Associations support the proposal to require interconnection
customers to submit interconnection requests during the cluster request window.548
MISO supports the Commission requiring a definitive application deadline as part of the
implementation of cluster studies, and equal interconnection queue priority for all
interconnection requests submitted prior to that deadline, but does not see an intrinsic
value in a defined application start time.549 MISO supports granting interconnection
customers flexibility to submit an interconnection request earlier than the beginning of a
cluster request window. Noting that, under proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.4.5,
interconnection requests that are deemed valid during the customer engagement window
are placed into the cluster study, Southern proposes that if an interconnection request is
not deemed valid, the interconnection request should be withdrawn from the
interconnection queue.550

MISO expresses concern that the timelines listed in the customer engagement
window for posting information are impractical.551 MISO asserts that the Commission
should not require a posting so near to the close of the cluster request window because
the transmission provider must devote its resources to reviewing the interconnection
requests for deficiencies.552 MISO contends that this information would only be useful at
this time to interconnection customers with speculative interconnection requests that may
be trying to determine if their proposed generating facility is economically viable and that
may be trying to identify a point of interconnection change to increase the viability of
their interconnection requests.
MISO argues that the Commission should not require any informational posting
pertaining to an interconnection request prior to the interconnection customer’s
finalization of the interconnection request because a definitive point of interconnection
has not yet been selected.553 MISO highlights that the proposed pro forma LGIP section
3.4.5 requires the transmission provider’s OASIS posting to include “(3) the station or
transmission line where the interconnection will be made.”554 However, MISO notes that
an interconnection customer is not required to select a definitive point of interconnection

until the end of the customer engagement window. As such, MISO contends that the
posting requirement is impossible if the transmission provider is required to post the
point of interconnection. MISO argues that the Commission should not require any
posting until a reasonable period after the interconnection customer is required to select
its definitive point of interconnection and the information is complete, such as when the
customer engagement window is completed and cluster studies are about to begin.
Regarding the makeup of the cluster, Clean Energy States assert that the cluster
study process should allow for changes in the makeup of the cluster, and that the study
process may identify ways to improve a cluster to provide better performance for the
transmission system, such as by adding or subtracting certain interconnection requests
from the cluster.555 Clean Energy States assert that a transmission provider should be
able to modify the cluster in response to interconnection customer changes or study
findings without threatening the interconnection customer’s queue priority or paying
penalties.
EPSA argues that the final rule should specify that transmission providers are
required to work with interconnection customers during the customer engagement
window and study agreement negotiation in a manner that is fair and equitable regarding
the study models to be used, data verification, and stakeholder engagement—regardless

Enel recommends that the Commission consolidate the interconnection request
and cluster and facilities study agreements into a single study agreement to be submitted

how to prepare to apply.560
Other commenters argue that the proposed 45-calendar day time frame for the
cluster request window is too short and should be increased to 60 calendar days.561 ISONE states that, based on its experience implementing its forward capacity market process,
each of the cluster study windows proposed in the NOPR should be extended to help
ensure an efficient cluster study process.562 Pine Gate also argues that a longer cluster
request window would reduce the burden on transmission providers by providing more
time to administer their deficiency notice processes.563 Pine Gate explains that, for larger
interconnection customers that may be developing numerous interconnection requests for
multiple transmission providers, overlapping cluster request windows are likely.
Additionally, Pine Gate contends that, as contemplated by the NOPR, it is likely that
increased requirements and additional information for interconnection customers will be

due at the time of interconnection queue entry (e.g., the complex modeling required to be
submitted) and burdensome to accommodate in the proposed time frame.
On the other hand, some commenters argue that a shorter cluster request window
is appropriate. CAISO argues that longer cluster request windows result in low quality
requests because interconnection customers have more time within the window to fix
their submissions.564 CAISO contends that its use of a shorter 15-day interconnection
request completeness window followed by a longer validation and scoping meeting
window have significantly improved interconnection request quality and the speed with
which CAISO processes requests. 565 Similarly, Tri-State recommends that the cluster
request window be shortened because, based on its experience, most interconnection
requests submitted in the cluster request window are received the last two days of the
request window.566

10 business days after receiving notice of deficiencies in the interconnection request, but
no later than the close of the cluster request window, does not take into account that most
requests are not submitted until the last day of the cluster request window.567
Regarding the number of cluster request windows opened each year, a couple of
commenters argue that there should be more than one cluster request window per year.568
Clean Energy States assert that, because presumably there will be fewer generator
interconnection studies to be done, transmission providers should provide opportunities
more frequently (e.g., quarterly) for interconnection customers to submit interconnection
requests.569 Environmental Defense Fund argues that the Commission should require that
the cluster request windows occur bi-annually, rather than once a year, to reduce the
delay caused by missing a cluster request window while still covering a large enough
time period that a number of interconnection requests will be included in each cluster.570
Southern generally agrees with the Commission that a cluster study process,
including the individual facilities study, should be completed within a year, but
recommends eliminating unnecessary delays, such as multiple, overlapping clusters, by
only permitting one cluster study at a time (i.e., that a new cluster should not commence

until the previous cluster has been completed).571 According to Southern, under this
format, an annual cluster study can be performed because the previous cluster study
process has been completed. Southern asserts that overlapping cluster study processes
will not help end interconnection queue backlogs and uncertainty, but rather add to them.
Regarding the length of the customer engagement window, Clean Energy
Associations support the proposed 30-calendar day time frame for the customer
engagement window as a baseline.572 A number of commenters argue that the proposed
30-calendar day customer engagement window is too short and recommend a longer
window.573 Duke Southeast Utilities argue that, based on experience with Duke
Carolinas Utilities’ cluster study process, which includes a 60-calendar day customer
engagement window, the proposed 30-calendar day customer engagement window may
not provide sufficient time to facilitate robust engagement.574 Duke Southeast Utilities
therefore urge the Commission to adopt a 60-calendar day customer engagement window.

customer engagement window to 95 calendar days to allow interconnection customers
additional time to reevaluate their readiness in a way that includes other customers.575
ISO-NE suggests a 90-calendar day customer engagement window.576 In addition,
ISO-NE suggests that the Commission clarify that transmission providers may withdraw
interconnection requests for which the models and data do not meet the requirements
following the customer engagement window in order to improve efficiency. ISO-NE
further asks that the Commission recognize the role of the participating transmission
owners in performance of interconnection studies and build time into the cluster study
time frames that accounts for this coordination.
Indicated PJM TOs argue that there should be a 30-calendar day window after the
date that the cluster request window closes, and between the time the transmission
provider posts the interconnection cases for the cluster study and the cluster study
commences, during which interconnection customers qualified to receive CEII
information have the opportunity to conduct their own studies with the transmission
provider’s base case and the new interconnection service requests. Indicated PJM TOs
assert that during this time, interconnection customers should be able to withdraw their
interconnection request with minimal financial impact.577

APS states that multiple customers requesting individual scoping meetings could
place a significant burden on the transmission provider to schedule several meetings
under a condensed time frame if the customer engagement window remains 30 calendar
days.578 For example, APS states that, assuming all notifications of valid interconnection
requests are made by the time the customer engagement window starts, the
interconnection customer has 15 business days to request an individual meeting and, if an
interconnection customer uses all 15 business days, that is a minimum 21 calendar days
out of the total 30 calendar days of the overall customer engagement window. APS
contends that this leaves nine calendar days at most (i.e., no more than seven business
days) to schedule an individual customer meeting, which could be less if there are
holidays occurring within the customer engagement window.
Similarly, Tri-State argues that the proposed 30-day customer engagement
window is not sufficient to meet the purpose of the customer engagement window and
recommends it be extended to allow adequate time to cure deficiencies and hold
individual scoping meetings.579 Tri-State argues that a 75-day customer engagement
window would give interconnection customers an opportunity to: (1) assess the viability
of their proposed generating facilities before committing to the interconnection process

and subjecting themselves to a withdrawal penalty; and (2) cure deficiencies in their
interconnection requests.580
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed new pro forma LGIP section 3.4.1 (Cluster Request
Window), which provides that interconnection customers must submit an interconnection
request during a specified period—the cluster request window—a 45-calendar day period
with the start date to be determined by each transmission provider. We also adopt the
non-refundable $5,000 application fee required to be submitted with the interconnection
request.581 We also adopt the requirement that interconnection customers provide
requested information within 10 business days of receiving an interconnection request
deficiency notice but no later than the close of the cluster request window, as proposed
and adopted in new pro forma LGIP section 3.4.4 (Deficiencies in Interconnection
Request), but we modify that section to clarify the timeline for curing deficiencies. We
modify the proposed new pro forma LGIP section 3.4.5 (Customer Engagement
Window) and extend the customer engagement window from 30 days to 60 calendar
days.
To ensure clarity for both interconnection customers and transmission providers,
based on the record, we believe that 45 calendar days is a sufficient window to

We note that the application fee is separate from the initial study deposit,
commercial readiness deposit, and deposit in lieu of site control.

adequately notify prospective interconnection customers of the formation of a new cluster
but not so long as to delay the processing of the interconnection queue.
Contrary to commenters’ assertions, we are not persuaded to extend the cluster
request window. We do not believe that more time is needed for transmission providers
to work with interconnection customers that submitted invalid interconnection requests to
cure deficiencies, particularly given the limit we adopt on the time for such additional
information to be submitted by interconnection customers, and because the start date of
the cluster request window will be included in the transmission provider’s LGIP for
prospective interconnection customers. We similarly do not believe that shortening the
cluster request window would result in fewer “low quality” interconnection requests, as
CAISO argues. Given the package of reforms adopted in this final rule, we expect fewer
speculative interconnection requests and that interconnection customers will be more
likely as a result of this final rule to submit interconnection requests for proposed
generating facilities that they believe are viable and ready to move forward in the
interconnection process.
As for Tri-State’s concern about the requirement for correcting deficiencies in new
pro forma LGIP section 3.4.4 (Deficiencies in Interconnection Request),582 we clarify
that the 10-business day window is the maximum time allowed to submit a response.
This means that an interconnection customer that submits its interconnection request
more than 10 business days before the close of the cluster request window will have a full

582

10 business days to submit a response, whereas an interconnection customer that does not
submit its interconnection request until less than 10 business days before the close of the
cluster request window will have however many days remain in the cluster request
window to respond to any deficiencies. Accordingly, we modify pro forma LGIP section
3.4.4 to provide that if the interconnection customer does not respond before the
deadline: (1) the interconnection request is immediately deemed withdrawn (without the
cure period provided under pro forma LGIP section 3.7); (2) the application fee is
forfeited to the transmission provider; and (3) because the cluster study has not
commenced, the study deposit and commercial readiness deposit are returned to the
interconnection customer.
We decline to adopt revisions to the pro forma LGIP to require biannual or
quarterly cluster study windows, as suggested by Clean Energy States and Environmental
Defense Fund. Based on the record, we are not convinced that mandating multiple
cluster request windows per year will result in a more efficient cluster study process,
especially considering the various sizes of transmission provider footprints and
interconnection queues. As we adopt an annual cluster study process, an annual cluster
request window will allow transmission providers to dedicate resources to the cluster
request window only once per year, dedicating their resources to the remainder of the
cluster study process for the rest of the year. We also are not convinced by
Environmental Defense Fund’s concern with interconnection customers missing a cluster
request window, as the date of the start of the cluster request window will be in each
transmission provider’s LGIP, providing sufficient notice for prospective interconnection

customers to prepare required application materials accordingly. We do not believe that
additional rules are needed to govern how transmission providers will inform
interconnection customers about the cluster request window.
We disagree with Southern’s suggestion that the cluster study process should only
permit transmission providers to conduct one cluster study at a time (i.e., eliminating the
possibility of conducting multiple cluster studies at any time). Prohibiting the
transmission provider from conducting overlapping cluster studies, in the instance where
it is necessary to process cluster subgroups or to process delayed studies, would delay the
interconnection process for interconnection customers. We therefore find that this
suggestion would contribute to more backlogs and uncertainty, as delays to any cluster
study would significantly delay cluster studies for all remaining interconnection requests
in an interconnection queue and would be insufficient to ensure that interconnection
customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner. Transmission providers with the capacity to conduct
multiple cluster studies at a given time should be permitted to do so to facilitate more
effective and efficient interconnection processes.
In response to MISO’s concern about posting requirements close to the conclusion
of the cluster request window, we reiterate that we are extending the length of the
customer engagement window from the proposed 30 calendar days to 60 calendar days,
which will allow transmission providers a total of 60 calendar days from the close of the
cluster request window to post the list of interconnection requests for that cluster.

MISO argues that the Commission should not require any OASIS posting prior to
the interconnection customer’s finalization of the interconnection request because a
definitive point of interconnection would have not yet been selected.583 While we
recognize MISO’s concern about transmission providers posting interconnection request
information on OASIS that may later change, we find that providing as much information
as possible to interconnection customers early in the customer engagement window
provides important transparency to improve interconnection queue processing. Providing
information about other interconnection requests that may be studied within the same
cluster to interconnection customers considering whether to execute a cluster study
agreement and to continue with the cluster, may help them determine the viability of their
proposed generating facilities, making it less likely that interconnection customers will
withdraw later in the cluster study process, triggering delays and restudies and the
associated problems discussed in Section II of this final rule.
We disagree with Clean Energy States’ assertion that a cluster should be able to be
modified in response to interconnection customer changes or study findings without
threatening the interconnection customer’s relative queue priority or paying penalties.584
Any interconnection customer that submits a valid interconnection request during the
customer request window will become part of the cluster, if the interconnection customer
chooses to execute a cluster study agreement by the end of the customer engagement

window. The transmission provider may not modify the makeup of the cluster or pick
and choose which interconnection customers to keep in the cluster in the way Clean
Energy States describes. We also note that interconnection customers can request a
modification assessment pursuant to section 4.4 of the pro forma LGIP.
Regarding the customer engagement window, we adopt the NOPR proposal to add
a new section 3.4.5 (Customer Engagement Window) to the pro forma LGIP, which
provides that, following the close of the cluster request window, the transmission provider
begins a customer engagement window. Additionally, we modify the proposal to extend
the customer engagement window from 30 calendar days, as proposed, to 60 calendar
days. Under this provision, the transmission provider must post new cluster information
on OASIS with details of each interconnection request for that cluster, including
information on the amount of interconnection service and the location of the proposed
generating facility, within the first 10 business days of the customer engagement window.
While we extend the customer engagement window from 30 calendar to 60 calendar days,
we retain the proposed 10 business day deadline by which the transmission provider
must post new cluster information on OASIS. We find that it is more beneficial for
interconnection customers to have this information as early as possible, such that they are
able to assess the composition of the cluster and make informed choices moving forward
with their interconnection requests earlier rather than later in the customer engagement
window. Further, during the customer engagement window, an interconnection customer
may withdraw its interconnection request without penalty.

We extend the customer engagement window to 60 calendar days in response to
numerous commenters’ arguments that 30 calendar days is insufficient to adequately
engage with interconnection customers in a cluster, including based on experience
implementing a similar cluster study process to that we require as part of this final rule.585
By extending the customer engagement window, we provide transmission providers with
additional time to conduct individual meetings with interconnection customers that
submitted interconnection requests within the cluster request window, lessening the
burden on transmission providers, particularly larger transmission providers such as
RTOs/ISOs.586 At the same time, we provide interconnection customers with more time
to consider information collected during this period of engagement with the transmission
provider—including the makeup of the cluster—and assess the continued viability of
their proposed generating facilities before withdrawal of the interconnection request will
incur a penalty. For example, the interconnection customer can assess the expected costs
of potential network upgrades and the impact of those costs on the viability of its
proposed generating facility in the context of the size and location of other
interconnection requests in the cluster. Interconnection customers will have 46 calendar
days to consider the posted information (which must be posted within 10 business days
after the start of the customer engagement window). Not only will this longer time

period for interconnection customers to consider whether to withdraw their
interconnection requests prior to the start of the cluster study save interconnection
customers’ resources by avoiding future penalties, but it will also result in more efficient
interconnection queue processing with fewer withdrawals later in the cluster study
process—withdrawals that can trigger restudies and cause the problems discussed in
Section II of this final rule.
We reject Southern’s suggestion that if an interconnection request is not deemed
valid,587 the interconnection request should be withdrawn from the interconnection queue.
Under new section 3.4.5 of the pro forma LGIP, any interconnection requests not deemed
valid at the close of the customer engagement window will not be included in the cluster.
This provision is designed to ensure that interconnection customers and transmission
providers have sufficient time to conduct scoping meetings and to discuss and
comprehensively evaluate whether interconnection requests are fully valid during the
customer engagement window. We find that forced withdrawals prior to the close of the
customer engagement window could result in potentially valid interconnection requests
being rejected prior to allowing for interconnection customers and transmission providers
to discuss alternative interconnection options, exchange information that could impact
such options, and conduct due diligence informed by information discussed during the
customer engagement window per the provisions set forth in new pro forma LGIP section
3.4.6 detailing scoping meetings.

In response to EPSA,588 we note that transmission providers and interconnection
customers should always work in a manner that is fair and nondiscriminatory, including
during the customer engagement window and study agreement negotiation.
We decline to adopt MISO’s suggestion that transmission providers allow
interconnection customers to submit an interconnection request prior to the beginning of
the cluster request window. We note that the cluster request window is specifically
designed to structure when transmission providers should expect interconnection
customers to submit interconnection requests for assessment. We find that allowing
interconnection request submission prior to the cluster request window may be
burdensome to transmission providers, who would have to dedicate staff and resources
towards assessing the viability of interconnection requests before the designated request
window opening, instead of concentrating their resources towards the prior stage of the
interconnection process.
We agree with Enel’s recommendation that the Commission include language in
the pro forma LGIP that, in the cluster study process, the transmission provider will not
post detailed information about interconnection requests proceeding or withdrawing until
all interconnection requests successfully meet their milestone requirements to proceed,
withdraw, or fail to cure their breach within the specific cure period. We note that
transmission providers are required to post this information at the conclusion of the
cluster request window, at which point interconnection customers must provide

significant requirements to proceed. We find that maintaining confidentiality early in the
customer engagement window stage is appropriate to reduce opportunities for developers
to gain competitive advantage over others before interconnection requests have been
finalized and accepted by the transmission provider. We therefore adopt the following
modification to section 3.4.5 of the pro forma LGIP (addition in italics): “Within
ten (10) Business Days after the close of the Cluster Request Window, Transmission
Provider shall post on its OASIS site a list of Interconnection Requests for that Cluster.
The list shall identify, for each anonymized Interconnection Request[s]: (1) the requested
amount of Interconnection Service; (2) the location by county and state; (3) the station or
transmission line or lines where the interconnection will be made; (4) the projected InService Date; (5) the type of Interconnection Service requested; and (6) the type of
Generating Facility or Facilities to be constructed, including fuel types, such as wind,
natural gas, coal, or solar. The transmission provider must ensure that project
information is anonymized and does not reveal the identity or commercial information of
interconnection customers with submitted requests.” Further, as discussed below, we
modify section 3.4.6 of the pro forma LGIP to require that transmission providers
exercise the use of non-disclosure agreements to maintain confidentiality of identifying
or commercially sensitive information for all other interconnection customers in a group
scoping meeting.

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to renumber and revise section 3.4.4 of

interconnection customers whose valid interconnection requests were received in that
cluster request window.589 Revised section 3.4.6 of the pro forma LGIP would also

MISO supports the Commission requiring individual customer-specific scoping
meetings only when requested by interconnection customers.590 APS agrees that a single
scoping meeting with all interconnection customers in the cluster during the customer
engagement window is beneficial to transmission providers and eases the burden of
scheduling individual meetings with all parties. However, APS has concerns about
security and confidentiality.591 APS notes that, currently, each interconnection customer

clarity on whether the requirements to treat additional information as confidential no
longer apply or if there is a form of good utility practice as it pertains to holding a single
scoping meeting without revealing the identities of the other interconnection customers
involved and some examples thereof.
MISO expresses concern that the timelines listed in the customer engagement
window for posting information are impractical. MISO asserts that the Commission
should not require a posting so near the close of the request window because the
transmission provider must devote its resources to reviewing the interconnection requests
for deficiencies.592
Enel and AEE argue that the Commission should also require transmission
providers and transmission owners to hold individual, customer-specific scoping
meetings at the request of the interconnection customer before the customer commits to
entering the cluster.593 Enel states that an individual pre-interconnection queue scoping
meeting would be an opportunity for the interconnection customer to ask basic questions
that can help inform economically significant decisions an interconnection customer
faces in deciding to enter the interconnection queue.594 As an alternative to requiring a
pre-interconnection queue meeting, Enel suggests that the Commission could require

customers could submit interconnection-related questions and be guaranteed a response
in time to inform decisions on entering the interconnection queue.
PJM believes that “grouping kick off meetings” will reduce the burden on
transmission owners and providers of scheduling and participating in hundreds of
meetings, and the burden on interconnection customers of waiting for their meeting to be
scheduled.595 PJM requests clarification that a transmission provider may group requests
for this customer engagement window unless an interconnection customer requests
otherwise.
Tri-State asks the Commission to consider providing only one week to schedule
the requested individual customer-specific scoping meeting if the interconnection
customer does not request a scoping meeting until the fifteenth business day.596
Noting the difficulty of coordinating in-person scoping meetings, SEIA requests
that the Commission clarify that both generating facility-specific and cluster scoping
meetings must provide the option for interconnection customers to attend via
teleconference, which is currently not available in all regions.597 Enel suggests that, for

interconnection requests were received in that cluster request window. We decline to
adopt the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to hold individual customerspecific scoping meetings at the interconnection customer’s request.
These revisions to the pro forma LGIP align the timing and purpose of scoping
meetings between transmission providers and interconnection customers with the
adoption of the cluster study process in this final rule. We do not believe that providing
the option for interconnection customers to request an individual customer-specific
scoping meeting is necessary to ensure that interconnection customer-specific questions
are answered as interconnection customers consider whether to remain in the
interconnection queue for the cluster study or to withdraw their interconnection request.
We find that this requirement would be comparatively inefficient and burdensome for
transmission providers, leading to potentially significant interconnection delays. We thus
find that this requirement would be inconsistent with the goal to ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a

reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. We find that the cluster-wide scoping
meeting is an appropriate forum in which all interconnection customers can direct
questions to transmission providers in an efficient manner without delaying the cluster
process with unnecessarily time-consuming individual scoping meetings.
We agree with APS’ concerns pertaining to good utility practices599 for security
and confidentiality regarding the disclosure of potentially sensitive commercial
information during the cluster scoping meeting that will include numerous
interconnection customers in the cluster.600 We therefore modify section 3.4.6 of the
pro forma LGIP to require that transmission providers use non-disclosure agreements to
maintain confidentiality of identifying or commercially sensitive information for all other
interconnection customers in a group scoping meeting until the close of the customer
engagement window.
In response to Enel and AEE,601 we will not modify the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to hold individual interconnection customer-specific scoping

Good utility practice means “any of the practices, methods and acts engaged in

expected to accomplish the desired result at a reasonable cost consistent with good

rather to be acceptable practices, methods, or acts generally accepted in the region.” See

meetings at the request of the interconnection customer before the interconnection
customer commits to entering the cluster. As discussed above, we decline to adopt a
requirement that transmission providers conduct individual interconnection customer
scoping meetings. Additionally, as discussed above,602 we adopt the heatmap
requirement, which will assist interconnection customers prior to entering the
interconnection queue in evaluating the viability of their proposed generating facilities,
and we are also permitting interconnection customers to withdraw from the
interconnection queue without penalty prior to the close of the customer engagement
window. With these reforms, we do not believe that pre-interconnection queue scoping
meetings should be required to ensure just and reasonable rates.
In response to MISO’s concern about posting requirements close to the conclusion
of the cluster request window,603 we find that allowing transmission providers a total of
10 business days from the close of the cluster request window to post the required list of
interconnection requests for that cluster is a reasonable amount of time.
In response to SEIA,604 we decline to modify the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to include an option for interconnection customers to attend via

meetings with interconnection customers is needed in the pro forma LGIP.
In response to Enel,605 we decline to modify the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission owners, not just interconnection customers and transmission providers, to
attend scoping meetings. The pro forma LGIP contemplates that the transmission owner
and transmission provider may be the same entity, except in the case of an RTO/ISO, in
which case the transmission owner does not have operational control of the facilities and
does not perform cluster studies. In the case of an RTO/ISO, only the entity that
independently administers the cluster study is required to attend the scoping meeting.

Posting of Metrics for Cluster Study Processing Time and
Restudy Processing Time

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the requirements included in
section 3.5.2 of the pro forma LGIP to post metrics for interconnection feasibility study
processing time and system impact study processing time, to instead require transmission
providers to post metrics for cluster study processing time and cluster restudy processing
time.606 The Commission also proposed to require transmission providers to post the
time from when the transmission provider received a valid interconnection request to the
completion of the cluster study, cluster restudy, and facilities study.

Specifically, in section 3.5.2.1 of the pro forma LGIP, the Commission proposed
requiring that transmission providers must post the number of interconnection requests
that had cluster studies completed within the transmission provider’s coordinated region
during the reporting quarter that were completed more than 150 calendar days after the
close of the customer engagement window. Similarly, in section 3.5.2.2 of the pro forma
LGIP, the Commission proposed requiring that transmission providers must post the
number of interconnection requests that had cluster restudies completed within the
transmission provider’s coordinated region during the reporting quarter that were
completed more than 150 calendar days after the transmission provider’s receipt of the
interconnection customer’s executed cluster restudy agreement.
In section 6.4 of the pro forma LGIP, the Commission proposed that transmission
providers publicly post new metrics requirements on their websites pertaining to various
technical specifications for, and impacts of, potential generating facilities on the
transmission provider’s transmission system, requiring that these metrics must be updated
on the transmission provider’s website “within 30 days after the completion of each
Cluster Study and Cluster Restudy period.”607

for cluster study processing time and cluster restudy processing time, starting from when

the transmission provider received a valid interconnection request.608 Clean Energy
Associations further argue that these reports should also identify the level of accuracy of
these studies relative to final costs.
While supportive of the use of metrics that reflect cluster study and cluster restudy
processing time, some commenters do not support measuring these metrics from the date
that the transmission provider received the interconnection request.609 APS argues that
this seems contradictory to the NOPR proposal that the 150-day timeline to process
cluster study requests begins at the end of the customer engagement window.610 MISO
asserts that for study metrics to be a useful measurement of whether a transmission
provider is meeting its tariff deadlines, the start date used in the metrics must reflect
when studies actually commence.611 MISO notes that an interconnection customer may
choose to submit its interconnection request weeks ahead of the cluster request window
deadline and that the time between that deadline and study commencement is variable.612
MISO urges the Commission to allow RTOs/ISOs flexibility to maintain metrics that
reflect their tariff deadlines, especially where the RTO/ISO already has a Commissionapproved cluster study process.

Ameren contends that if the Commission retains the proposal to require the
posting of the time from when the transmission provider received a valid interconnection
request to the completion of the cluster study, cluster restudy, and facilities study, it
should clarify that in the context of an RTO/ISO, “complete” refers to the final sign-off
by the RTO/ISO.613 Ameren asserts that transmission owners within an RTO/ISO may
act on behalf of the RTO/ISO transmission provider for purposes of certain studies;
however, it is the RTO/ISO and not the transmission owner that decides when a study is
complete.
In section 6.4 of the pro forma LGIP, regarding the proposed requirement that
“[t]hese metrics must be updated within 30 days after the completion of each Cluster
Study and Cluster Re-study period[,]” Enel recommends that the word “period” should be
deleted. Enel argues that the trigger should be the completion of the studies
themselves.614

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed revisions to section 3.5.2 of the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to post metrics for cluster study processing time and cluster
restudy processing time, including the number of cluster studies completed within
150 calendar days of the close of the customer engagement window. We modify

new requirement adopted in section 7.5 of the pro forma LGIP that cluster restudies
should be completed within 150 calendar days of the transmission provider notifying
interconnection customers in the cluster and that a cluster restudy is required. The
requirement to post these metrics replaces the existing requirement to post metrics for
interconnection feasibility study processing time and system impact study processing
time, which were relevant for the serial study process but are no longer relevant for the
cluster study process required by this final rule. We therefore believe that these revisions
are necessary to implement the change from a serial study process to the cluster study
process.
As for the point at which to begin measuring the metrics, several commenters
argue against using the date on which the transmission provider received the
interconnection requests. We clarify that sections 3.5.2.1 and 3.5.2.2 of the pro forma
LGIP adopted in this final rule establish that these metrics must be measured from the
close of the customer engagement window for the cluster study processing time metric
and from when transmission provider notifies interconnection customers in the cluster
that a cluster restudy is needed for the cluster restudy processing time metric. We find
that these are appropriate start dates from which to calculate the metrics because they
reflect when the respective studies are to actually commence.615 We decline to grant

additional flexibility to maintain metrics and associated timelines for those metrics, as
urged by MISO.616
Regarding Clean Energy Associations’ suggestion that the metrics also identify the
level of accuracy of studies relative to final costs,617 we decline to adopt this suggestion.
For one, it is unclear to what final costs Clean Energy Associations is referring to.
Additionally, the metrics that we require transmission providers to post as part of this
final rule focus on the timing of interconnection studies and not on the accuracy of cost
estimates. The metrics are intended, as described in Order No. 845, to provide needed
transparency “to allow interconnection customers to develop informed expectations about
how long the interconnection study portion of the process actually takes.”618
We decline to adopt Ameren’s suggestion to base the 150-calendar day cluster
study deadline on the RTO/ISO’s completion of the cluster study rather than the
transmission owner’s completion because the deadlines are applicable to the transmission
provider and such a clarification is unnecessary to be added to the pro forma LGIP.
We agree with Enel’s suggestion to modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 6.4
– now pro forma LGIP section 6.1 – by deleting “period” because, as Enel explains, this

Interconnection Request Evaluation Process
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed several changes to pro forma LGIP
section 4, renamed “interconnection request evaluation process” from “queue position.”
First, the Commission proposed to rename and revise section 4.1 of the pro forma LGIP
as “queue position” and added two new proposed sections: (1) section 4.1.1 (Assignment
of Queue Position), which provides that queue position will be based on the time and date
that the transmission provider receives all items required under section 3.4 (Valid
Interconnection Request) and that there is no queue priority for interconnection
customers that opted for informational interconnection studies; and (2) section 4.1.2
(Higher Queue Position), which provides that all interconnection requests studied in a
single cluster shall be considered to have equal queue priority, but clusters initiated
earlier in time shall be considered to have a higher queue position than clusters initiated
later in time.620
The Commission also proposed to remove from section 4.2 of the pro forma LGIP
the provisions allowing transmission providers to study interconnection requests serially
and the requirement for transmission providers to provide 180 calendar days’ advance

notice before opening a cluster window.621 The Commission also proposed to rename
section 4.2 of the pro forma LGIP “general study process,” and revise it to require
transmission providers to perform interconnection studies within the cluster study
process.
In the NOPR, the Commission also proposed changes to the material modification
provisions in section 4.4 (Modification) of the pro forma LGIP to provide that moving a
point of interconnection shall result in a loss of interconnection queue position if it is
deemed a material modification by the transmission provider. Additionally, proposed
additions to pro forma LGIP section 4.4 require that any identified changes to a planned
interconnection, proposed by an interconnection customer or the transmission provider,
must be acceptable to any impacted interconnection customer in the same cluster, and
such acceptance is not to be unreasonably withheld.622 The Commission noted that the
interconnection customer may decide to forego the requested change that constitutes a
material modification and retain its existing queue position.623
Further, the Commission proposed to revise section 4.4.1 of the pro forma LGIP to
make clear that: (1) the modifications previously permitted prior to return of the
executed system impact study agreement are now permitted to be made prior to return of
the executed cluster study agreement; and (2) for generating plant increases, the

incremental increase will be studied with the next cluster study for purposes of cost
allocation and study analysis.624 Pro forma LGIP section 4.4.1 also explicitly permits
specific modifications prior to the interconnection customer’s return of the executed
cluster study agreement to the transmission provider, including: (a) a decrease of up to
60 percent of electrical output (MW) of the proposed project, through either a decrease in
plant size or a decrease in interconnection service level; (b) modifying the technical
parameters associated with the generating facility technology or step up transformer; and
(c) modifying the interconnection configuration.

Comments

With regards to the proposed changes to section 4.1 (Queue Position), Tri-State
questions whether the proposed definition of queue position includes surplus
interconnection requests.625 Xcel argues, and EEI agrees, that the Commission should
modify the proposal to clarify that queue position or queue priority is based on
interconnection request readiness and not on the date and time the interconnection request
is submitted.626
CAISO asserts that it is unclear what losing a queue position means in a clusterbased study (e.g., being withdrawn from the interconnection queue or moving to a lower
interconnection queue position), but also contends that no specification or reform is

necessary because interconnection customers will simply withdraw the modification
every time if it is found to be material.627 CAISO argues that the Commission should
either remove the “option” to lose an interconnection queue position when a proposed
modification is found to be material, or clarify what replaces the interconnection queue
position when it is lost.
Clean Energy States argue that, in addition to the “signs of commercial progress”
proposed by the Commission, clusters should be prioritized for study based on a number
of other transparent and quantifiable factors, such as alignment with state policy (e.g.,
participation in procurement actions), and benefits to low-income, environmentally
impacted, and “energy communities” as defined under the Inflation Reduction Act, state
policies, and the Justice40 Initiative.628 Clean Energy States assert that clusters could
further be prioritized for development by how well the combined cluster meets
transmission system needs, with preference for interconnection agreements given to those
that result in the lowest cost upgrades, have the most attractive operational profile, or
deliver the best reliability improvements.
Regarding the proposed changes to pro forma LGIP section 4.4 (Modifications),
Enel argues that the Commission should remove the proposed language requiring the
acceptance of “any impacted Interconnection Customer in the same Cluster” to modify an

interconnection request.629 Enel asserts that this requirement not only will be challenging
to facilitate (especially in large clusters) but is also a redundant and unnecessary hurdle
that could result in anticompetitive behavior. If the Commission keeps this language, to
avoid uncertainty regarding the application of this provision, Enel proposes to replace
this language with “any Interconnection Customer in the same Cluster whose
interconnection would be delayed or whose interconnection-related costs would be
increased as a result of the identified changes.”630
A few commenters argue that the Commission should consider changes to the
material modification process such that only certain modifications trigger a restudy.631
Clean Energy Associations recommend that the Commission modify the current material
modification definition to clearly state that certain changes are presumptively immaterial,
such as changing solar modules or turbines, adding storage capacity, or making minor
adjustments to inverter performance. Clean Energy Associations argue that this
presumption should be in place so long as planned export and import capacity remains
the same.632 Clean Energy Associations also support the concept of expedited, limited
studies for project modifications, provided that: (1) an expedited approach does not

change the level of interconnection service; (2) there is no impact on cost or timing of an
interconnection request that is lower- or equally queued; and (3) it does not cause any
reliability concern. Additionally, Pattern Energy asserts that, in its experience,
transmission providers apply widely disparate standards where even de minimis
impacts—timing or financial—can be determined to be material, which Pattern Energy
believes is unreasonable and unduly discriminatory in light of the dynamic nature of the
generator interconnection processes.633 Pattern Energy argues that, absent severe delay,
timing delay should not be factored into materiality. Pattern Energy suggests instead that
materiality be tied to financial impact on a proposed generating facility (or group of
proposed generating facilities).
With regard to modifications under proposed pro forma LGIP section 4.4.1, MISO
supports the proposed revisions to avoid proposed project service level increasing634 and
other changes disrupting cluster studies that are in progress or delaying the negotiation
and execution timelines for the LGIA.635

interconnection studies, otherwise, it argues that, interconnection customers are more

likely to work around the rules by submitting multiple smaller interconnection requests to
retain size flexibility after seeing their initial results, which is more administratively
burdensome for transmission providers and leads to its own form of inefficiency as size
reductions come in the form of withdrawals at any point in the process rather than being
limited to partial reductions prior to entering the cluster restudy.636
CREA and NewSun argue that the Commission should explicitly permit
interconnection customers to modify their interconnection requests to reduce or eliminate
the assignment of network upgrade or stand alone network upgrade costs associated with
a proposed generating facility after receipt of the first cluster-level interconnection
study.637 CREA and NewSun argue that interconnection customers should be permitted
to modify their proposed generating facilities to avoid impacts on the transmission system
that trigger network upgrades by, for example, reducing their capacity or installing
devices that will limit their output during critical periods.638 CREA and NewSun state
that the existing pro forma LGIP allows an interconnection customer to downsize its
interconnection capacity up to 60% upon receipt of the first interconnection study (i.e.,
the feasibility study) and before progressing to the second study (i.e., the system impact

study).639 CREA and NewSun state that, in contrast, the NOPR proposes to only allow
downsizing to occur before receipt of the first cluster system impact study and, as a
result, the opportunity to downsize the interconnection request to tailor the facility to the
available capacity identified in the first useful interconnection study would be lost.
Therefore, CREA and NewSun argue that the Commission should revise the NOPR
proposal to ensure that a reasonable amount of downsizing (e.g., 60%) is permitted after
receipt of the first cluster-level interconnection study.640

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 4.1 (Queue Position),
section 4.2 (General Study Process), and section 4.4.1, and we modify the proposed
definition of queue position and the proposed revisions to the material modification
provisions in section 4.4 (Modification). These are discussed below.
First, we adopt the proposed revisions to section 4.1 of the pro forma LGIP
(Queue Position), which reflect the impact of the adoption of the proposed cluster study
process in this final rule on queue position assignments. These revisions provide that
transmission providers must assign queue positions based on the date and time of receipt
of a valid interconnection request, but all interconnection customers that submit
interconnection requests within a cluster request window must be considered equally

queued. Clusters initiated earlier in time must have a higher queue position than clusters
initiated later in time. Under the existing serial study process in the pro forma LGIP,
queue position had a greater effect on an interconnection customer, for instance, in the
allocation of network upgrade costs. By contrast, network upgrade costs within a cluster
will not be allocated by queue position; rather, as discussed below, network upgrade costs
within a cluster must be allocated generally through a proportional impact method among
the interconnection customers in the cluster. Given the nature of the cluster study
process, including the nature of the cost allocation for network upgrades, it is appropriate
for all interconnection customers in a cluster to be considered equally queued.
Second, we adopt the proposal to remove from section 4.2 of the pro forma LGIP
the provisions allowing transmission providers to study interconnection requests serially
and the requirement for transmission providers to provide 180 days’ advance notice
before opening a cluster window. We also adopt the proposal to rename section 4.2 of
the pro forma LGIP “General Study Process” and revise it to require transmission
providers to perform interconnection studies within the cluster study process. These
revisions are necessary to implement the cluster study process required by this final rule.
As requested by Tri-State, we clarify that the definition of queue position is not
relevant to surplus interconnection requests, which are processed outside of the normal
interconnection queue, as further discussed in Section III.A.2.n below.
We also maintain the language in the pro forma LGIP that moving a point of
interconnection in a way that is deemed a material modification will impact an
interconnection customer’s queue position, but we clarify the meaning of this in the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 208 -

context of the cluster study process. Specifically, if moving a point of interconnection is
deemed by the transmission provider to be a material modification to the interconnection
request, and the interconnection customer chooses to proceed with the proposed
modification, the interconnection request will be deemed withdrawn and the
interconnection customer must re-enter the interconnection queue with a new
interconnection request, if it desires to proceed to interconnect. To avoid being deemed
withdrawn, the interconnection customer may choose not to move its point of
interconnection and to instead remain in the same cluster with the original
interconnection request, and, thus, in the same queue position.
In response to CREA and NewSun, we do not opine on whether moving a point of
interconnection within a cluster will be a material modification. Instead, we leave the
determination as to whether it is deemed a material modification to the transmission
provider, as in the existing process for determining whether a proposed modification is
material.
We decline to adopt Clean Energy States’ suggestion that, in addition to the “signs
of commercial progress” proposed by the Commission, clusters should be prioritized for
study based on other transparent and quantifiable factors.641 Clean Energy States neither
provides sufficient rationale or detail regarding such factors by which clusters would be
prioritized by transmission providers, nor explains how such prioritization criteria would
be determined. We note that the Commission did not propose alternative factors for

consideration. Additionally, we note that the record lacks adequate discussion in favor of
such prioritization mechanisms or such “factors” for the Commission to consider
adopting in this final rule.
Third, we modify the proposed definition of queue position in the pro forma LGIP
and LGIA to provide that queue position is established pursuant to section 4.1 of the pro
forma LGIP. Fourth, we modify the proposed revisions to the material modification
provisions in section 4.4 (Modification) of the pro forma LGIP. We adopt the language
that provides that moving a point of interconnection shall result in a loss of queue
position if it is deemed a material modification by the transmission provider, for the
reasons discussed above. At the same time, we modify the proposed revisions to remove
the requirement to obtain the approval of “any impacted Interconnection Customer in the
same Cluster.”642 We are persuaded by Enel’s argument that this proposed language in
pro forma LGIP section 4.4 should be struck for two reasons. First, we find this language
unnecessary because the point of interconnection could be changed only if the
transmission provider had deemed it to not be a material modification to the
interconnection request. Through this requirement, the transmission provider’s analysis
ensures that the change will not have a material impact on the cost or timing of another
interconnection request in the cluster. Second, although the proposal included the
language “such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld,” we are still concerned

customers in the cluster could refuse to accept the point of interconnection change to
limit competition. The interconnection customers within a cluster will be competitors in
the wholesale markets in many, if not all, respects. To ensure competitive market
outcomes, they should not be provided an undue opportunity to affect the advancement or
the costs for a proposed generating facility of one of their competitors.
A number of commenters argue that the Commission should consider changes to
the material modification process such that only certain modifications trigger a restudy.643
We decline to adopt any of the suggested revisions to the material modification
provisions and restudy triggers in the pro forma LGIP. We did not propose changes
suggested by commenters and do not find the need to adopt such changes to the material
modification provisions to ensure just and reasonable rates. We believe that the list of
permitted modifications in section 4.4 of the pro forma LGIP is appropriate because they
allow interconnection customers a degree of flexibility with respect to generating facility
size, interconnection service level, and specific generating facility technology that
appropriately balances the high burden to enter the interconnection queue and the lengthy
duration of the interconnection queue, during which external factors may change,
including the introduction of new technology that interconnection customers may wish to
incorporate into their generating facility design.

Finally, we adopt the proposed revisions to section 4.4.1 of the pro forma LGIP to
make clear that: (1) the modifications previously permitted prior to the return of the
executed system impact study agreement are now permitted to be made prior to return of
the executed cluster study agreement; and (2) for plant increases, the incremental increase
will be studied with the next cluster study for purposes of cost allocation and study
analysis. We believe that these revisions are needed to implement the cluster study
process adopted to ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the
transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. Notably, we
believe that prior to the return of the executed cluster study agreement is the appropriate
time to permit the modifications previously permitted prior to the return of the executed
system impact study agreement because these represent approximately the same point of
the interconnection process in a serial study process versus a cluster study process. For
plant increases, we find that it is appropriate to exclude increases to proposed generating
facility size from the cluster study that is ongoing as any increase to size may create the
need for restudies. By moving the increase to the subsequent cluster, the interconnection
customer can still pursue its requested addition, albeit on a delayed schedule.
We decline to adopt Enel’s alternative proposed language that would allow the
same modifications permitted to be made prior to the executed cluster study agreement to
also be permitted before a cluster restudy. This would not only represent a significant
change from the existing modification language in pro forma LGIP section 4.4.1, but
allowing such modifications at the cluster restudy stage could negatively affect the
integrity of the cluster and cause further restudies, which would not ensure that

interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.
We also decline to adopt the revisions suggested by CREA and NewSun that
would explicitly permit interconnection customers to modify their interconnection
requests to reduce or eliminate the assignment of network upgrade or stand alone network
upgrade costs associated with a proposed generating facility after receipt of the first
cluster-level interconnection study. The “loss” of the opportunity for interconnection
customers to downsize the interconnection request to tailor the facility to the available
capacity identified in the first useful interconnection study644 reflects the nature of
moving from a serial study process, with an initial, high-level feasibility study, to a
cluster study process, with the benefit of a customer engagement window, potential for
shared cost allocation, and lower likelihood of cascading restudies. Moreover, providing
interconnection customers an opportunity to reduce the size of their proposed generating
facilities after the cluster study would undercut the increased certainty and efficiency that
are key benefits of the shift to a cluster study process. With the adoption of clusters, a
reduction in size that may eliminate one interconnection customer’s cost responsibility
for a network upgrade could affect other interconnection customers in the cluster, either
by increasing their costs or requiring a different network upgrade. This type of
uncertainty could lead to further reductions, withdrawals, and restudies, and would be
insufficient to ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the

however, that interconnection customers may request a material modification assessment
under section 4.4 of the pro forma LGIP for reductions and that if those reductions are
found to not be material, the interconnection customer may proceed with them without a
loss of queue position.

Fewer than Three Year Extension to Commercial
Operation Date
i.

NOPR Proposal

Currently, if an interconnection customer’s generating facility is delayed by fewer
than three years, the pro forma LGIP states that such extensions are not material and shall
be handled through construction sequencing. However, the pro forma LGIP does not
state the starting point for this fewer than three-year period. In the NOPR, the
Commission proposed to revise section 4.4.5 of the pro forma LGIP, which currently
allows an extension of less than three cumulative years of the generating facility’s
commercial operation date, to require that the commercial operation date reflected in the
initial interconnection request be used in calculating the permissible fewer than threeyear extension.645

executed LGIA, rather than the date in the initial interconnection request, are generally

more accurate646 and provide more certainty when established at the end of the
interconnection study process as they would include the schedule estimates for network
upgrades,647 and the interconnection customer may have greater control over pursuing its
development timeline.648
Invenergy argues that, because assigned upgrades necessary for interconnection
can require more than three years for construction, it would be reasonable to permit a
greater extension right of five years from the date set out in the LGIA.649 Enel also
argues that the Commission should grant a longer extension of time if the transmission
provider’s studies are delayed or if more time is required to build network upgrades
because these circumstances are beyond the interconnection customer’s control.650 Enel
also recommends requiring the transmission provider to grant a day-for-day delay to the
originally requested commercial operation date for any delays in the study process
relative to the LGIP deadlines as well as due consideration for network upgrades that
require more than 18 months to design, procure, and construct.

Ameren and PPL assert that continuing to provide a three-year extension of the
commercial operation date would allow projects to move forward when they are not
ready or viable.651 APS believes that limiting the ability to suspend interconnection
requests or extend the commercial operation date to instances of force majeure, including
where a customer demonstrates specific timeline obstructions such as permit issuance or
supply chain delays, is more in line with the proposals in the NOPR.652
NV Energy seeks clarification on how long an interconnection customer may extend
its commercial operation date because the pro forma LGIP allows seven to 10 years from
the initial interconnection request to construct.653 NV Energy requests clarification on how
the three-year suspension clause in the pro forma LGIA plays into the timeline for the

that are otherwise provided under the pro forma LGIP or an LGIA.655 For example, some
transmission owners have taken the position that, when exercising a suspension right, if the
suspension would result in an in-service date greater than seven years after the date
specified in the interconnection request, the interconnection customer cannot use its full
suspension period. Invenergy asserts that the Commission has already clarified that the
interconnection request limitation on proposed in-service dates is applicable only for the
purpose of limiting the date requested at the application stage, and does not limit in-service
dates that extend beyond that period as a result of other factors, which would include
transmission owner delay, exercise of suspension, and here, additional commercial
operation date extensions.656 Invenergy also states that the Commission should clarify that
its revisions to pro forma LGIP section 4.4.5 are in addition to, and do not limit, an
interconnection customer’s suspension rights under its interconnection agreement.657

cumulative years of the generating facility’s commercial operation date without requiring
them to request such an extension from the transmission provider. In response to
commenters’ concerns, however, we modify our proposal to clarify that the commercial
operation date reflected in the initial interconnection request shall be used in calculating
the permissible fewer than three-year extension until the interconnection customer
executes, or requests the unexecuted filing of, an LGIA. Once the interconnection
customer has executed an LGIA or requested that the LGIA be filed unexecuted, the
commercial operation date established in the LGIA shall be the date from which the up to
three cumulative years is calculated.
At the time the pro forma LGIP was adopted, the interconnection process was
considerably shorter than it is now; the delays and sizeable interconnection queues facing
transmission providers create a situation where many interconnection customers use this
up to three-year period to ensure that their proposed generating facilities reach
commercial operation. Furthermore, the length of the interconnection queues is such that
at the time an interconnection customer enters the queue, it may have little idea of how
long it will spend in the interconnection queue before commencement of the construction
of its generating facility and required interconnection facilities and network upgrades.
Thus, we agree with Invenergy, Ørsted, and Pine Gate, and we modify our proposal to
require the up to three-year period to commence from the commercial operation date
established in the interconnection customer’s LGIA once the LGIA is executed or the
interconnection customer has requested that it be filed unexecuted with the Commission.

We decline commenters’ requests to revise the actual length of the permissible
extension of a proposed generating facility’s commercial operation date. The Commission
did not propose to change the length of the permissible extension in the NOPR, and we
lack an adequate record that the existing up to three-year extension is unjust and
unreasonable.
Commenters request clarification658 of how the changes to pro forma LGIP
section 4.4.5 adopted in this final rule affect other provisions such as pro forma LGIP
section 3.4.2 and pro forma LGIA article 5.16, which provide for extensions of the inservice date or suspension of construction.659 We reiterate that the revisions to section
4.4.5 of the pro forma LGIP adopted in this final rule establish only the starting point for
the less than three-year extension to the commercial operation date. The Commission did
not propose in the NOPR, and we do not adopt in this final rule, changes to the extension
of in-service date provisions in pro forma LGIP section 3.4.2, or to the suspension
provision in pro forma LGIA article 5.16.

Specifically, pro forma LGIP section 3.4.2 (previously pro forma LGIP section
3.4.1) provides that the expected in-service date of the new generating facility or increase
in capacity of the existing generating facility shall not exceed seven years, but may be
extended up to 10 years upon mutual agreement of the transmission provider and
interconnection customer. Pro forma LGIA article 5.16 provides the interconnection
customer the right to suspend work by the transmission provider associated with the
construction and installation of transmission provider’s interconnection facilities and/or
network upgrades for up to three years, at which time the LGIA would be deemed
terminated.

NOPR Proposal

As part of the proposed revisions to the pro forma LGIP, the NOPR proposed to
replace section 6 (Interconnection Feasibility Study) with the new requirements to
publicly post interconnection information, i.e., the “heatmap” as discussed above in
Section III.A.1.c, thereby removing the entirety of the feasibility study from the pro
forma LGIP.660 Furthermore, in the NOPR, the Commission proposed to rename pro
forma LGIP section 7 from “interconnection system impact study” to “cluster study.”661
The Commission proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 7.1 (Cluster Study
Agreement) to state that the transmission provider must tender to each interconnection
customer that submitted a valid interconnection request a cluster study agreement no later
than five business days after the close of the cluster request window.662 The Commission
proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 7.2 (Execution of Cluster Study
Agreement) to state that if the interconnection customer does not provide technical data
when it delivers the cluster study agreement, the transmission provider must notify the
interconnection customer of the deficiency within five business days, and the
interconnection customer must cure the deficiency within 10 business days of receipt of

of Cluster Study Agreement) to make clear that the stability analysis, power flow
analysis, and short circuit analysis previously conducted under the feasibility and system
impact studies would be conducted on a clustered basis.664 The Commission also
proposed changes to pro forma LGIP section 7.3 to make clear that, for purposes of
determining necessary interconnection facilities and network upgrades, the cluster study
shall use the level of interconnection service requested by interconnection customers in
the cluster, except where the transmission provider otherwise determines that it must
study the full generating facility capacity due to safety or reliability concerns. The
Commission proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 7.4 (Cluster Study
Procedures) to state that, within 10 business days of simultaneously furnishing a cluster
study report and a draft facilities study agreement to each interconnection customer
within the cluster and posting such report on OASIS, the transmission provider shall
convene an open meeting to discuss the study results and shall, upon request, make itself
available to meet with individual interconnection customers after the report is
provided.665 Pro forma LGIP section 7.4 also states that the transmission provider must
complete the cluster study within 150 calendar days. The Commission proposed
revisions to pro forma LGIP section 7.5 (Cluster Study Restudies) to state that the

transmission provider must take when a restudy is required or not required.666

MISO supports the deletion of section 6 of the pro forma LGIP and the removal of

In reference to the proposed revisions to section 7.1 (Cluster Study Agreement) of

tender a valid cluster study agreement to each interconnection customer that submitted a
valid interconnection request and argues that this timeline is not feasible for transmission
providers with greater than 50 interconnection requests submitted in a cluster request
window.668

identified by the transmission provider.669
In reference to the proposed revisions to section 7.3 (Scope of Cluster Study) of
the pro forma LGIP, Tri-State asks the Commission to add language to address situations
with studies pending completion of higher-queued project cluster studies.670
Enel proposes an alternative method for performing the cluster study and restudy
to the NOPR proposal.671 Enel states that if the Commission wants to retain the full
scope of analyses in the cluster study, the Commission could require draft power flow
analyses to be provided to interconnection customers part way through the cluster study.
Enel explains that interconnection customers could be granted the right to reduce
interconnection service amounts and make other changes pursuant to pro forma LGIP
section 4.4.1 following receipt of these results. Enel states that the transmission provider
would repeat the power flow analyses until the queue stabilized, with the motivation for
interconnection customers to make changes in a timely way being driven by knowledge
that once the latter portion of the studies started, the interconnection customer would lose
this flexibility.

In the list of requirements to proceed to the cluster restudy in proposed revisions to
section 7.5 of the pro forma LGIP, Enel proposes to add “(d) election of project changes
as permitted by LGIP section 4.4.1.”672
In the proposed revisions to section 7.5 of the pro forma LGIP, Enel suggests
removing item (2), which states that if there are no changes to the composition of the
cluster, a cluster restudy is not required, because it claims that the cluster restudy would
always be required, at least in part, to add short circuit and stability analyses.
With regard to the 150-day cluster study deadline, some commenters generally
support the proposed 150-day deadline to complete the cluster study.673 Enel
recommends a reduction in the scope and schedule of the cluster study to only include
power flow analysis and a short circuit ratio test (to test grid strength and flag potential
inverter instability issues) and suggests that this initial cluster study be completed in 90
days instead of 150 days.674 Enel contends that, the availability of some information
from this first study, interconnection customers retain more flexibility up to the point of
committing to the initial cluster restudy, which allows interconnection customers to
optimize the characteristics of their proposed generating facilities, most notably the
amount of ERIS and NRIS interconnection service requested, in response to the results of

the study. Enel argues that early flexibility for optimization of proposed generating
facilities is better than forcing interconnection customers to withdraw and re-enter the
interconnection queue, is less disruptive, and does not add a year of delay to an
interconnection customer completing the interconnection process.
A number of commenters argue that the proposed 150-day deadline to complete
the initial cluster study may be, or is, too short and recommend a longer study window.675
A few commenters also argue that the study timelines are too short, given the proposal to
eliminate the reasonable efforts standard and impose penalties on transmission providers
that miss those deadlines.676 National Grid asserts that the proposed 150-day deadline
may be “unreasonably condensed” and could result in a decline in the quality of the
studies, which could lead to delays.677 Specifically, National Grid claims that rushing the
issuance of the cluster study could lead to later amendments or corrections to certain
engineering requirements or cost estimates, that in turn may lead to later-stage
interconnection request withdrawals.
Tri-State notes that it currently implements a 270-day system impact study period,
specifically 150 days for phase 1 (power flow, short circuit, reactive capability) and
120 days for phase 2 (short circuit, transient stability), and has yet to miss a study

deadline.678 Tri-State argues that this time frame allows for a thorough study process,
including coordination with neighboring systems and the correction of errors found in
interconnection customers’ modeling data.
AES contends that cluster study timelines should be tailored to the types of studies
being completed at each stage of the respective cluster.679 For example, AES states that
steady state analysis takes less time to complete than dynamic analysis, meaning that a
longer time frame should be afforded for dynamic analysis in the cluster study process.
Accordingly, AES recommends that the Commission adopt a 150-day general study
timeline for cluster studies and restudies (system impact study-steady state, and shortcircuit analysis performed) and a 200-day timeline for facilities studies (dynamic analysis
performed).
APS requests that the Commission extend the initial study time frame to 180 days
to provide meaningful studies identifying feasible proposed generating facilities,
explaining that the APS transmission system is situated in such a way that many
interconnections are at jointly owned facilities that require reviews and sign-off from
multiple owners, including non-jurisdictional entities.680 APS argues that 180 days is
more prudent for initial studies, with the exception of specific criteria such as jointly
owned facilities, Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) rated paths, and

federally owned and Tribal lands, for which studies take significantly longer despite good
faith efforts.
NYTOs and National Grid argue that the proposal is not clear on which specific
steps would be included in the 150-day time frame for the initial cluster study and argue
that certain additional special studies that a transmission provider may need to perform
should not be subject to a 150-day time frame.681 NYTOs state that it is unclear when the
clock starts for the proposed 150-day cluster study deadline and how the scope of the
work can be reasonably limited to comply with the 150-day deadline.682 NYTOs argue
that transmission providers and transmission owners should be afforded the flexibility to
provide clarifications and supporting details on compliance.
Similarly, National Grid notes that certain RTO/ISO interconnection processes
require special supplemental studies in addition to general system impact studies and that,
while the NOPR recognizes that these studies may be required to ensure reliable
interconnection of new generating facilities, it does not address whether such studies
must be conducted within the proposed 150-day cluster study window or could be
conducted outside of this window.683 National Grid argues that the time to complete such
special studies should not be included in the NOPR’s proposed 150-day cluster study
window and that the final rule should allow regions to adjust their overall interconnection

timelines to accommodate such region-specific studies and take into consideration the
time required to develop system models. Finally, National Grid states that the NOPR
does not address whether the 150-day cluster study window includes the time required to
develop system models and base case data for the cluster study.
Several commenters recommend that the Commission provide transmission
providers with flexibility to specify study timelines.684
Regarding the 150-day cluster restudy deadline, several commenters agree that the
150-day deadline is reasonable for a cluster restudy.685 Other commenters oppose the
150-day deadline. Bonneville argues that the proposed requirement to conduct a cluster
restudy within 150 days is unworkable because the complexity of the cluster restudy
would vary and directly impact the completion timeline.686 Therefore, Bonneville seeks a

On the other hand, several commenters argue that the deadline to conduct a cluster
restudy should be shorter.687 AES recommends that the Commission instead require
transmission providers to include restudies and model rebuilds between cluster study
phases, and to require that the timeline for such model rebuilds and restudies cannot be
greater than 90 days.688 Enel similarly asserts that if the Commission leaves the cluster
study timeline at 150 days and does not change the study scope, the timeline for cluster
restudies should be 90 days.689
A few commenters argue that a 30-day window per restudy is more reasonable
because network models are already built, and therefore substantially fewer staff
resources should be required than for the initial study.690 Cypress Creek adds that a
shorter restudy window will also help avoid potential delays in a cluster study process in
which multiple restudies are required.691 AEE also recommends that the Commission
limit interconnection restudy timelines to 30 days, arguing that this will encourage
transmission providers to treat customers in interconnection restudy with the same
urgency as customers in the initial interconnection study, eliminating the possibility of

asymmetric treatment of interconnection customers and alleviating interconnection queue
congestion by moving those interconnection customers that have been in the
interconnection queue the longest to study completion.692
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed deletion of the feasibility study as effectuated by the
replacement of the current section 6 (Interconnection Feasibility Study) of the pro forma
LGIP with the new heatmap requirements, as discussed in Section III.A.1.c. The move
from a serial interconnection process to the new cluster study process, coupled with the
Commission’s heatmap requirements, render the feasibility study redundant at best and
an unnecessary burden on transmission provider resources. As discussed in Section
III.A.1.c, above, we find that the publicly available information required by this final rule
will provide the appropriate level of pre-interconnection queue information for
interconnection customers to make informed choices.
We also adopt, with one modification, the proposed revisions to section 7 of the
pro forma LGIP that rename it “cluster study” instead of “interconnection system impact
study,” which set out the requirements and scope of the cluster study agreement, as well
as the cluster study and restudy procedures. These revisions reflect the adoption of the
cluster study process set forth in this final rule by making clear that the interconnection
studies that transmission providers previously performed as part of the serial system
impact studies (i.e., stability analysis, power flow analysis, and short circuit analysis)

must now be conducted on a clustered basis. As discussed further in Section III.A.6 of
this final rule, pro forma LGIP section 7.5 is modified to remove the requirement to
provide an initial study deposit that would have been applied towards the cost of the
cluster study process.
We are not persuaded by Tri-State’s concern that five business days after the close
of the cluster request window is too short a time frame for a transmission provider to
tender a cluster study agreement to each interconnection customer. Transmission
providers may start to prepare cluster study agreements before the close of the cluster
request window, as the overall terms and conditions of the cluster study agreement are
standardized so that a transmission provider need not engage in rewriting each agreement
before tendering a draft to the interconnection customer.
In response to Tri-State’s comments concerning section 7.2 of the pro forma
LGIP, we confirm that an interconnection request is considered withdrawn if the
interconnection customer does not cure deficiencies identified by the transmission
provider. We note that under new section 3.4.4 of the pro forma LGIP, if a transmission
provider identifies that an interconnection customer’s technical data are incomplete or
contain errors, both parties must “work expeditiously and in good faith to remedy such
issues,” but the failure by the interconnection customer to provide the missing data or
correct data errors will be treated as a withdrawal and dealt with under pro forma LGIP
section 3.7 (Withdrawal).
In reference to Tri-State’s comments on the proposed revisions to section 7.3 of
the pro forma LGIP, we decline to add language to address situations with studies

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 231 -

pending completion of higher-queued project cluster studies because Tri-State’s
comments are unclear as to what additional language may be needed.
We decline to adopt the alternative methods to perform cluster studies and
restudies suggested by Enel. The current pro forma LGIP does not prescribe particular
study methods and instead provides discretion to transmission providers to determine the
particular methods of study appropriate for their transmission systems. We do not, based
on the record in this proceeding, find a basis to determine that existing study methods are
unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential. We also decline to add
Enel’s suggested section (d) to section 7.5 of the pro forma LGIP. Pro forma LGIP
section 4.4.1 contains the modifications permitted to an interconnection request prior to
the return of an executed cluster study agreement, which predates any potential cluster
restudy. We further note that the record does not support Enel’s modification request.
We decline to adopt the provision requiring transmission providers to hold cluster
study report meetings with individual customers as proposed in section 7.4 of the pro
forma LGIP. We find that the individual meetings would be unnecessary, and that
individual customers should utilize the group cluster study report meeting as a more
efficient forum in which to address any questions or concerns pertaining to the cluster
study report. We also find that requiring transmission providers to conduct individual
meetings would impose unnecessarily burdensome additional requirements on
transmission providers and would be insufficient to ensure that interconnection customers
are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and
timely manner.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 232 -

Also, we decline to remove proposed section 7.5(2) of the pro forma LGIP, as
suggested by Enel. Contrary to Enel’s claim, pro forma LGIP section 7.3 establishes that
the cluster study will consist of short circuit and stability analyses; therefore, we disagree
with Enel that a cluster restudy will be needed in all cases to perform the short circuit and
stability analyses. Section 7.5(2) states that if there are no changes to the composition of
the cluster, a cluster restudy is not required. We find that this is appropriate as it prevents
the transmission provider from performing an unnecessary restudy if no conditions have
changed after the first cluster study. This will increase efficiency, free up the
transmission provider’s resources to perform other studies, and increase the speed of
interconnection, ensuring that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the
transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.
Based on the record, we find that a 150-calendar day cluster study deadline
provides a sufficient time to allow transmission providers to perform the stability
analyses, power flow analyses, and short circuit analyses required in the cluster study
process for complex clusters consisting of numerous interconnection requests. We find
that the 150-calendar day time frame balances providing transmission providers with
sufficient time to perform these technical cluster studies while providing certainty about
the timeline for the interconnection process and ensuring that cluster studies progress in a
timely manner. We note that depending on the cluster size, cluster studies may not
always consume the entire 150 calendar days, and if a cluster study is complete prior to
this deadline, transmission providers have flexibility to provide the cluster study report at
that time prior to the deadline indicated in its LGIP and commence any necessary

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 233 -

restudies or move to the facilities study phase. We also note that if a transmission
provider progresses to the next study phase prior to the deadline indicated in its LGIP, the
transmission provider must post any changes on its website or OASIS.
We disagree with Enel’s suggestion to reduce the scope and schedule of the cluster
study in the proposed pro forma LGIP. The cluster study represents the first time the
interconnection customer will obtain information about its potential interconnection
costs. At this point, interconnection customers will have to make significant financial
decisions about whether to remain in the interconnection queue. The information
provided in the cluster study report will likely dictate that decision, and we find that the
scope of the study is appropriate to allow interconnection customers to make these types
of decisions and evaluate whether they will face significant risk. Given that we decline to
reduce the scope of the study, we find Enel’s request to reduce the timeline overly
restrictive. Enel’s proposal would create significant burden on transmission providers to
perform complex studies in an even shorter timeline, and we therefore decline to adopt it.
We also disagree with commenters that argue that the 150-calendar day time frame
to complete the cluster study is too short. As discussed above, numerous commenters
agree with the Commission’s conclusion that the significant interconnection queue
backlogs create uncertainty and risk in bringing new generating facilities online, rendering
Commission-jurisdictional rates unjust and unreasonable. While we have extended the
timeline from that provided in the individual serial study process, we believe that 150
calendar days is a reasonable extension to account for the more complex study. We also
note that transmission providers will be conducting only one interconnection study, or at

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 234 -

most a small number of interconnection studies, at a time, allowing them to devote more
resources to completing the studies in a timely manner. Thus, on balance, we believe that
150 calendar days represents an appropriate and reasonable timeline on which
transmission providers must complete initial cluster studies.
We disagree with NYTOs that it is not clear as to when the clock starts for the
proposed 150-calendar day cluster study deadline, as proposed pro forma LGIP section
7.3 contains this information (150 calendar days from the close of the customer
engagement window). We also disagree with NYTOs’ statement that it is not clear how
the scope of the work can be reasonably limited to comply with the 150-calendar day
deadline, as we are not proposing to limit the scope of work necessary to effectively run a
cluster study. As discussed above, we find that the 150-calendar day cluster study
deadline, combined with the fewer necessary studies, provides a reasonable amount of
time to allow transmission providers to perform the required studies.
In response to National Grid’s concern that some RTO/ISO interconnection
processes require supplemental studies and that these studies should not be required to be
conducted within the 150-calendar day cluster study window, we decline to modify the
pro forma LGIP to provide for more time for such studies. We also clarify for National
Grid that the 150-calendar day deadline includes the time required to develop system
models and base case data for the cluster study.
Regarding the 150-calendar day cluster restudy deadline, we agree with
commenters that the proposed 150-calendar day deadline is reasonable for a cluster
restudy. We acknowledge that some commenters argue that 150 calendar days is too

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 235 -

short, while others argue that it is too long. On balance, we find that 150 calendar days is
a just and reasonable time frame for purposes of the pro forma LGIP that allows
transmission providers to conduct potentially complex restudies for instances in which
larger clusters experience multiple withdrawals and/or modifications.
In response to commenters’ arguments that a 150-calendar day restudy deadline is
too long, we note that if transmission providers complete the cluster restudy prior to the
full 150-calendar day period elapsing, transmission providers may move to the facilities
study stage at that time. As such, the adopted 150-calendar day cluster restudy time
frame accommodates more complex instances of cluster restudies while still allowing
flexibility for transmission providers to move forward without waiting for the deadline to
pass if the restudy does not take the full 150 calendar days.
Additionally, we decline to adopt suggestions to allow transmission providers
flexibility to set their own study deadlines,693 which would undermine the purpose of
ensuring that transmission providers complete interconnection studies by standard
deadlines prescribed by their tariffs and would thus be insufficient to ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.

- 236 Restudies Triggered by Higher- or Equally Queued
Generating Facility
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise section 8.5 ( Restudy) of the pro
forma LGIP to make clear that restudies can be triggered by a higher- or equally queued
interconnection request withdrawing from the interconnection queue or modification of a
higher- or equally queued interconnection request pursuant to section 4.4 (Modifications)
of the pro forma LGIP.694
ii.

Comments

Shell argues the withdrawal of an interconnection request should not automatically
trigger a cluster restudy, and instead the Commission should consider a process and cost
allocation method that creates a “secondary market” to replace a proposed generating
facility that withdraws with another generating facility in the same location or nearby.695
CREA and NewSun agree with Shell’s suggestion to allow interconnection customers to
step in and assume the rights of any interconnection customer that withdraws its
interconnection request.696 Similarly, R Street argues that the cluster study process
should not impede the transfer of interconnection request “ownership,” as, according to R

Street, allowing parties to trade will help ensure an efficient balance between generation
additions and transmission interconnection costs.697
MISO seeks clarification on the trigger for restudies. MISO states that its
understanding is that any modification during its study process that is found to be
material would not be allowed.698 Further, MISO contends that allowing a material
modification to impact an equally queued interconnection customer seems to be
inconsistent with the Commission’s proposal to modify the definition of material
modification.699 Therefore, MISO argues that there should not be a need for a restudy
due to such modification. MISO asserts that the Commission should not allow
modifications during the study process that materially impact other interconnection
customers and may require restudies.
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt the proposed revisions to section 8.5 of the pro forma LGIP to make
clear that restudies can be triggered by a withdrawal or modification by a higher- or
equally queued interconnection request. First, we clarify that the “modification” we refer
to in this section must be explicitly permitted under pro forma LGIP section 4.4. Any
other modification that triggered a restudy would be found to be material and would not
be allowed, as it would affect the cost and/or timing of the other customers in the

interconnection queue by necessitating a restudy. Next, we find that restudies may be
triggered if there is either a withdrawal or a modification explicitly permitted under pro
forma LGIP section 4.4. Changes to the composition of the cluster often require the
transmission provider to restudy the entire cluster to ensure that all network upgrades and
the associated costs are still needed. Finally, we find that stating that restudy may be
required due to the withdrawal or modification of a higher- or equally queued
interconnection request, rather than requiring that a restudy must occur, provides the
transmission provider with flexibility to assess whether the restudy is necessary. If the
transmission provider is able to move forward without performing a full restudy, that is a
preferable outcome in terms of interconnection queue efficiency, as the transmission
provider can maintain the study milestones already achieved and maintain progress
towards completion and operation for generating facilities in the cluster, as opposed to
dedicating significant additional time required to restart and conduct the study process
over again when it may not be necessary or beneficial to do so.
In response to Shell, CREA and NewSun, and R Street, we decline to consider
modifications to the pro forma LGIP to create a “secondary market” process that would
allow one generating facility to replace a similarly situated one that withdraws from the
interconnection queue, where that withdrawal would otherwise trigger a restudy. The
Commission did not propose such a process in the NOPR, and we do not have a sufficient
record to consider adopting such a process in this final rule.
In response to MISO, we clarify that material modifications are defined in section
1 of the pro forma LGIP as modifications that have a material impact on the cost or

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

timing of any interconnection request with an equal or later queue position. Under
section 4.4.3 of the pro forma LGIP, if an interconnection customer chooses to move
forward with the modification that has been deemed material by the transmission
provider, the interconnection customer will lose its queue position and must proceed with
a new interconnection request if desired. However, we note that certain modifications as
listed in pro forma LGIP sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.5 are permitted regardless of their
impact on other interconnection customers.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise sections 11.1 (Tender) and 11.3

Comments

Enel states that many transmission providers and interconnection customers are
confused as to how to interpret pro forma LGIP sections 11.1 and 11.2 in relation to each
other, and Enel thus recommends that the Commission revise and simplify sections 11.1
and 11.2 of the pro forma LGIP to provide more clarity.701 Enel argues that additional

changes are needed to address common delays in completion of the final facilities study
report; delays in a transmission provider issuing the draft LGIA; and delays in the
transmission provider executing the LGIA after receiving the interconnection customer’s
signature and milestones, and subsequently proposes targeted revisions to pro forma
LGIP sections 11.1 and 11.2 to provide additional time for interconnection customers to
review and negotiate LGIAs.702
Tri-State notes that section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP is unclear when it states
that the “Transmission Provider must not suspend the LGIA” until the interconnection
customer meets the tariff requirements because it is the interconnection customer that has
the ability to suspend a proposed generating facility.703
APS requests that the Commission be more prescriptive on what is considered
reasonable evidence of achieving development milestones when executing an LGIA in
the same manner that the Commission defines commercial readiness milestones in order
to avoid subjectivity and potential disagreements regarding what is considered
“reasonable.”704 APS also asserts that the reference to simultaneous submission of the
interconnection customer-executed LGIA and the continued demonstration of site control
is duplicative and unnecessary if an interconnection customer demonstrates site control at
the time an interconnection request is made.

Hydropower Commenters contend that the Commission should provide additional
time for payment of interconnection costs after the interconnection process is
complete.705 Hydropower Commenters assert that once a transmission provider delivers
the interconnection agreement and construction agreement to the interconnection
customer, the interconnection customer has only 60 days to execute the agreements and
15 business days after receipt of the signed agreements to demonstrate site control or post
a non-refundable additional security deposit to cover the interconnection costs.
Hydropower Commenters argue that, because the end of the study process may occur
long before a proposed generating facility is fully funded, and the interconnection
customer risks losing its queue position if it does not execute the agreements, the
Commission should extend this period to at least one year so the interconnection
customer has time to secure funding and avoids having to restart the interconnection
process.
NV Energy similarly suggests changes to the NOPR proposal to allow
interconnection customers that request a transmission provider to file an unexecuted
LGIA to satisfy these requirements within 15 days of the Commission issuing an order.
NV Energy states that the proposed extra time between receiving a draft LGIA and
having to satisfy these requirements creates an undue preferential advantage for those
interconnection customers that request unexecuted LGIAs to be filed at the Commission

and could delay the interconnection process for others.706 To address this issue, NV
Energy suggests that interconnection customers who choose to have their unexecuted
LGIAs filed with the Commission should be required to submit their data to the
transmission provider by the day after the filing of the LGIA.
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt, in part, and modify, in part, the proposal to revise sections 11.1 and
11.3 of the pro forma LGIP, regarding the tendering, execution, and filing of the LGIA,
to incorporate a 60-calendar day negotiation period and to incorporate the site control
demonstrations and LGIA deposit provisions included in proposed section 3 of the pro
forma LGIP. We find that the revisions to section 11.1 of the pro forma LGIP that we
adopt herein clarify the process of tendering an LGIA and the revisions to section 11.3 of
the pro forma LGIP that we adopt herein incorporate the site control and LGIA deposit
provisions adopted elsewhere in this final rule.
We do not adopt the proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 11.3 that
reference the commercial readiness demonstration provisions of proposed section 8.1 of
the pro forma LGIP because we are not adopting those provisions, as discussed below in
Section III.A.6.
We modify the proposed revisions to pro forma LGIP section 11.3, as requested
by Tri-State, because we agree that the proposal was unclear when it stated that
“Transmission Provider must not suspend the LGIA under LGIA article 5.16” until the

706

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

interconnection customer meets certain tariff requirements. We modify pro forma LGIP
section 11.3 to instead state: “Interconnection Customer may not request to suspend its
LGIA under LGIA Article 5.16 until Interconnection Customer” meets certain tariff
requirements. This reflects the fact that it is the interconnection customer, not the
transmission provider, that has the right to suspend the LGIA.
We also modify proposed section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP in response to
NV Energy’s concerns about favoring interconnection customers that request a
transmission provider to file an unexecuted LGIA. We agree that the proposal has the
potential to encourage more filings of unexecuted LGIAs simply to delay the due date for
submission of deposits, evidence of site control, and milestone progress data. We
therefore modify the proposal such that interconnection customers that request a
transmission provider to file an unexecuted LGIA must satisfy these submission
requirements within 10 business days after the date of the filing of the unexecuted LGIA
with the Commission.
We decline to make further modifications to the proposal beyond those discussed
above. Enel has neither explained why pro forma LGIP sections 11.1, as revised by this
final rule, and 11.2, cause an unjust and unreasonable result for interconnection
customers, nor has it explained why changes to the negotiation process between
transmission providers and interconnection customers are needed at this time.
Similarly, we decline APS’ request that the Commission be “more prescriptive” on
what is considered reasonable evidence of achieving development milestones when
executing an LGIA. We believe that the requirement that interconnection customers

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 244 -

provide reasonable evidence is sufficient to ensure just and reasonable rates without
imposing detailed requirements surrounding the meaning of “reasonable.” There is
inadequate record to demonstrate a more prescriptive approach is needed. For example,
development milestones generally involve the execution of contracts or applications for
permits.
We also decline to adopt Hydropower Commenters’ request to modify the pro
forma LGIP to provide additional time for payment of interconnection costs after the
conclusion of the interconnection study process. The pro forma LGIP, as modified by
this final rule, requires transmission providers to give interconnection customers ample
notice of costs and the timing that costs are due as part of the interconnection process so
that interconnection customers can secure funding for a proposed generating facility. We
are unpersuaded that interconnection customers should have additional time beyond that
already provided, especially given the number of generating facilities that have been
developed using the existing process and the added transparency that we adopt in this
final rule that will only serve to improve the ability of interconnection customers to
secure financing.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission sought comment on whether to require
transmission providers to conduct cluster studies on subgroups of interconnection
customers based on areas of geographic and electric relevance, and, if so, whether to

adopt provisions governing how cluster areas should be formed to ensure that cluster
areas are formed in a transparent and not unduly discriminatory manner.707

Comments

A number of commenters support permitting transmission providers to study
clusters in subgroups based on geographic or electrical relevance,708 but some argue that
clustering projects in subgroups should not be required.709
Several entities argue that clustering around subgroups of geographic or electrical
relevance is a reasonable approach, particularly for transmission providers with a large or
fragmented footprint.710 Some commenters argue that creating sub-clusters may not
make sense for transmission providers with small footprints.711 Several commenters
argue that transmission providers should have flexibility in deciding whether to form
subgroups of interconnection customers because geographic and electric relevance will
vary with each cluster study.712 Similarly, some commenters contend that the

Commission should not mandate studying subgroups based on geographic and electric
relevance, and that the efficacy of this approach should instead first be evaluated through
experience.713
PacifiCorp notes that using cluster study areas allows it to assess and more
efficiently allocate the costs of network upgrades to requesters triggering the
improvements and protect interconnection customers in different clusters from bearing
the cost of network upgrades triggered by interconnection customers in different parts of
PacifiCorp’s system, thereby facilitating more expedient processing of all the cluster
studies.714 PacifiCorp asserts that its ability to create cluster areas where appropriate is a
critical feature of its cluster study process, adding that cluster areas can facilitate
expedient processing of interconnection requests that might otherwise be delayed due to
restudies or other study complications.715
On the other hand, Pattern Energy asserts that designating subregions may result
in separate geographic regions bearing a disproportionate share of network upgrade costs
that provide regional benefits and should be subject to regional cost allocations.716

would better serve the needs of the subregional clusters during each planning cycle.
Illinois Commission asserts that interconnection requests that are near one another might
have a greater impact on each other, and subgroups could ease the study process, but any
subgroup process should not compromise cost or timing efficiency gains that the
clustering process is meant to address.717 OPSI argues that to reduce the “first mover
disadvantage” most effectively, the Commission should continue to analyze and further
explain in any final rule whether a region-wide, annual cluster in a large region like PJM
could benefit from better defined subclusters.718 OPSI asserts that the Commission
should further evaluate methods to ensure that clusters facilitate identification of shared
network upgrades by grouping generating facilities based on areas of geographic and
electrical relevance.
Avangrid contends that the open call cluster request window should have
geographic distinctions, but that if the open call results in only one interconnection
request in a particular area of the system electrically, this interconnection should be able
to undergo a process reminiscent of current serial study processes in a parallel track if it
will influence, or be influenced by, the broader cluster study process.719

Some commenters argue that the Commission should set forth specific mandates
to transmission providers on how cluster areas should be formed.720 CREA and NewSun
argue that clear mandates would prevent transmission providers from subgrouping as a
means to engage in anti-competitive conduct (e.g., assigning the utility’s own generation
to subgroups with lower congestion or network upgrade costs).721 Similarly, Fervo
Energy contends that the Commission should adopt provisions governing how cluster
areas should be formed to ensure that clusters are formed in a transparent and not unduly
discriminatory manner.722
Other commenters argue that the Commission should provide flexibility by
creating a general framework for defining cluster study subgroups appropriate for their
own regions, rather than a specific set of requirements.723 Some commenters further
contend that transmission providers have extensive knowledge of their own transmission

develop subgroup criteria with stakeholder input.726
Other commenters argue that the Commission should allow variation in how
transmission providers form clusters. For example, R Street argues that the Commission
should refrain from being too prescriptive regarding how cluster areas are defined, and
instead require that transmission providers publish their cluster definitions well in
advance of the request window for interconnection requests.727 Clean Energy States
believe that allowing interconnection customers to create their own clusters would result
in an internal vetting of proposed generating facilities in the cluster and negotiation about
how costs and penalties will be managed.728 Regarding how clusters should be defined,
several commenters provide suggestions for subgroup criteria beyond geographic
proximity or electrical relevance.729 PPL suggests cluster formation be based on

considering cluster studies on subgroups of interconnection customers, those clusters
should be based on location.731 Clean Energy Associations, Vistra, and ENGIE assert
that cluster studies should evaluate subgroups of projects based on electric proximity to
one another.732 Further, ENGIE agrees that distribution factors should not be the sole
indicator of electrical proximity as there are other factors around which subgroups might

sufficient for only a subset of the interconnection requests; if the latter, Clean Energy
Associations continue, the Commission should establish a pro forma process for
determining which requests might proceed with those initial upgrades.735 Clean Energy
Associations claim that transmission development is a “lumpy” process, and in some
cases there can be “breakpoints” where adding one more generating facility can result in
a significant per-unit cost increase compared to the interconnection costs that could have
been achieved for a subset of the interconnection requests up to that point. Clean Energy
Associations state that, in the current ISO-NE cluster study process, ISO-NE attempts to
identify such breakpoints and fills each cluster up to that level, with remaining requests
able to either withdraw or proceed into the next cluster study. Some commenters contend
that studies should include or consider including breakpoints, which can provide helpful
information to inform interconnection customers’ next steps.736

Commission Determination

We will neither require transmission providers to conduct cluster studies on
subgroups of interconnection customers based on areas of geographic and electric
relevance, nor adopt provisions governing how cluster subgroup areas should be formed.
However, we adopt revisions to section 7.4 of the pro forma LGIP to permit transmission
providers to use subgroups in their cluster study process if they so choose. To the extent
a transmission provider chooses to use subgroups, it must include provisions in its pro
forma LGIP in its tariff that state that it will use subgroups. We further modify section
7.4 of the pro forma LGIP to require that the criteria used to define subgroups be publicly
posted on a publicly accessible website. We believe that publicly sharing these criteria is
important to ensure adequate transparency and to safeguard against the potential for
undue discrimination in the design and implementation of cluster subgroups.
We agree with commenters that support permitting transmission providers to study
clusters in subgroups based on geographic or electrical relevance but argue that clustering
projects in subgroups should not be required. We believe that there may be benefits to
studying clusters in subgroups in certain circumstances, and therefore we do not want to
preclude transmission providers from proposing such a process on compliance. At the
same time, based on the record, we do not believe that requiring subgroups for all
transmission providers is appropriate. In some instances, the administrative burden of
defining and separately studying subgroups may not outweigh the benefits.
Consistent with our decision to not require transmission providers to conduct
cluster studies on subgroups of interconnection customers, we decline to adopt provisions

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 253 -

governing how clusters should be formed. Rather, we believe it more appropriate to
allow transmission providers to determine how to define subclusters appropriate for their
regions, taking into consideration their system geography, electrical configuration, and
other relevant factors.738
Regarding concerns raised by Pattern Energy and others about the use of
subgroups resulting in a disproportionate allocation of network upgrade costs, we note
that if a transmission provider opts to study in subgroups, it cannot change how it
allocates network upgrade costs. That is, it must follow the requirement adopted in this
final rule to use a proportional impact method to allocate system network upgrade costs
among all interconnection customers in the cluster regardless of subgroup, as discussed
further below. Because transmission providers will be using a proportional impact
method to allocate system network upgrade costs, regardless of whether interconnection
customers are studied in subgroups , we believe subgroups would not change an
interconnection customer’s potential cost allocation. An interconnection customer with
an impact on a network upgrade would be allocated its portion of the cost of that network
upgrade regardless of whether its request was studied in a subgroup with another
interconnection customer allocated a different portion of that network upgrade.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission sought comment on whether to specify in the pro
forma LGIP how cluster studies must be rerun after restudy is triggered or whether there
are provisions the Commission could adopt to improve the efficacy of the restudy
process, such as preventing excessive restudy by limiting the transmission provider to
two restudies per month within the 150-calendar day cluster restudy period.739

Comments

Eversource recommends that the Commission adopt detailed restudy rules.740 Pine
Gate suggests that the Commission provide guidance on when the need for a restudy is
triggered, as even minimal changes can trigger long and costly restudies.741 Pine Gate
recommends that the Commission: (1) furnish criteria to be used by transmission
providers in determining whether a restudy is required; (2) require transmission providers
to limit the scope of restudies if only a local impact is anticipated; (3) require
transmission providers to publish restudy criteria, determinations, and scoping as
resources for interconnection customers; (4) permit interconnection customers to send
engineering analyses applying the transmission provider’s published criteria, which could
be used by the transmission provider to help decide whether to conduct a restudy, thereby

reducing the transmission providers’ burden; and (5) not require every cluster participant
to submit additional study deposits until the transmission provider determines the need
for and scope of any restudy and affected cluster participants are notified. Pattern Energy
believes that transmission providers should be required to develop expedited modeling
processes to evaluate whether the withdrawal of an interconnection request or other
allowed modification may cause a full restudy.742 Pattern Energy argues that such a
requirement would allow interconnection customers to make better informed decisions
about withdrawing or modifying interconnection requests.
Conversely, a number of commenters recommend that the Commission provide
flexibility to transmission providers and not adopt overly prescriptive requirements
specifying how cluster studies must be rerun after a restudy is triggered.743 MISO
encourages the Commission to grant maximum flexibility to transmission providers
regarding the necessity of restudies and the scope of restudies as the situations that give
rise to restudies are varied and unique.744 PJM states that it finds acceptable the NOPR’s
proposal requiring transmission providers to specify in their tariffs how cluster studies
must be rerun, but suggests the Commission avoid being overly prescriptive regarding

restudies.745 Xcel recommends that the Commission not propose additional prescriptive
requirements on how restudies must be performed, but suggests that if there are multiple
clusters impacted, where each cluster only has “ready” projects, the transmission provider
may combine the clusters into a single cluster for a single restudy instead of restudying
multiple clusters.746
Some commenters support limiting the number of restudies a transmission
provider may perform within a restudy period.747 Ameren states that limiting the number
of restudies to two within the 150-day cluster restudy period seems reasonable, given the
size of the many interconnection queues and the reported uncertainty of interconnection
customers in the queue.748 Ohio Commission Consumer Advocate concurs that
conducting a single cluster study and cluster restudy annually may reduce the risk of
cascading restudies occurring if an interconnection customer withdraws from the
interconnection queue.749
A few commenters argue that the Commission should address the lack of any limit
on restudy requests, stating that this issue is a known shortcoming that results in

essentially unlimited time and resource obligations for interconnection customers.750
Southern expresses concern that the proposed pro forma LGIP language allows for
multiple restudies, which would interfere with a one-year timeline maximum.751
A number of commenters do not support a set limit on the number of restudies a
transmission provider may perform.752 Bonneville asserts that efforts to prevent
excessive restudies (e.g., limit of two per month) could be overly prescriptive.753
Bonneville argues that transmission providers should be afforded the flexibility to
determine and publish the timing of any restudy, and limits thereto, on their OASIS sites
to help to facilitate transparency and ensure timelines are attainable. NextEra states that
experience has shown that having a defined and limited number of restudies, such as in
MISO’s three-phase process, can help limit the duration of the study process.754
However, NextEra contends that it would be too restrictive for the Commission to dictate
exactly how transmission providers should limit the number of restudies, and argues that

undefined and unpredictable number of restudies, e.g., whether it will have a fixed
number of scheduled restudies or some other method to limit the number of restudies and
associated potential delays. PacifiCorp notes that, because restudies are typically
triggered through a withdrawal or modification of an interconnection request, the
transmission provider is responding to changes, typically outside of its control, that
warrant a restudy and undertaking efforts to complete the restudy as efficiently as
possible.755
Idaho Power requests clarification surrounding the single cluster and cluster
restudy process and the suggested limitation of allowing only two restudies per month
within the 150-day cluster restudy period.756 Idaho Power states, for example, an entity
may have three cluster areas requiring three cluster studies, and withdrawals from those
studies may require more than two simultaneous cluster restudies in the same month to
prevent delay of any one cluster restudy.

Commission Determination

We decline to modify the pro forma LGIP to specify how a transmission provider
conducts cluster restudies and when it must conduct a cluster restudy. We find
persuasive the arguments of several commenters that the Commission allow transmission

frequency of any restudies. The transmission provider is best positioned to determine
when and how to conduct a restudy, including the scope and frequency of restudies,
because it determines the need for the restudies to maintain the reliability of the
transmission system.757 We agree with commenters like MISO and Xcel that different
events can trigger restudies, and transmission providers are in the best position to
determine whether an event warrants a restudy, and if so, what the scope of that restudy
should be (for example, whether a new study is required, or whether only a modification
as to certain model data and a reanalysis is required).758
As to frequency of restudies, we also agree with PacifiCorp that because restudies
are typically triggered through a withdrawal of an interconnection request, the
transmission provider is responding to changes, typically outside of its control, that
warrant a restudy, and thus limiting the number of restudies could hinder the ability of a
transmission provider to undertake efforts to complete a restudy as efficiently as
possible.759 Because we are not modifying the pro forma LGIP to specify how cluster
studies must be rerun after restudy is triggered, we will also not limit the transmission
provider to two restudies per month within the 150-calendar day cluster restudy period.
We agree with commenters like Bonneville, NextEra, and PacifiCorp that it would be too

Regarding Idaho Power’s request for clarification on the suggested limitation of
allowing only two restudies per month within the 150-calendar day cluster restudy

restudy period, Idaho Power’s clarification request is moot.

with some commenters supporting such an option only under specific circumstances.764
For example, Ørsted argues that such an option could be beneficial in the case of a stand

would be particularly beneficial as more renewable generating facilities are added to the
resource mix.767 Two commenters support exceptions for replacement resources

Additionally, APPA-LPPC request that the Commission recognize that there are
transmission providers, principally in rural communities or where the transmission
system provides limited opportunities for advantageous interconnections, where there are
too few interconnection requests to justify a cluster study approach.770 In these cases,
APPA-LPPC recommend that the Commission provide for a self-executing “opt out,”
permitting the transmission providers to continue to study interconnection requests on a
serial basis.
Northwest and Intermountain recommend a limited exception to the cluster study
process requirement to allow existing interconnection customers seeking to make changes
to their proposed generating facilities to be processed outside of the cluster study process
where the proposed change had no demonstrable incremental impact on the transmission
system.771
Xcel argues that proposed generating facilities needed to serve load should be
allowed to be processed outside of the annual cluster study process.772 AEP argues that
transmission providers with a reserve margin obligation must have the ability to prioritize

Iowa Commission argues that state commissions should have the ability to require
studies outside of annual cluster studies, which would help increase the availability of
needed generation for resource adequacy and maintain local reliability needs, particularly
as large intermittent generating facilities are interconnecting to the system at a rapid
pace.774 Iowa Commission explains that such studies could potentially address increased
transmission system stability and also minimize future transmission costs because of the
“transient nature” of some load and resource changes.
Similarly, UMPA contends that the Commission should require a process outside
of the annual cluster study process to expedite interconnection requests that are beyond
the exploration phase and ready for development.775 UMPA explains that some load
serving entities search for potential resources to meet their integrated resource plan based
on a request for proposal or certain competitive criteria, but are then confronted with a
choice among proposed generating facilities that meet the criteria but are lower in the
interconnection queue, or proposed generating facilities that do not satisfy the criteria, but
are higher in the interconnection queue. Therefore, UMPA argues that it would be
helpful to a load serving entity with a development-ready generating facility to be able to
enter into a parallel process outside of the annual cluster study process in order to
expedite an interconnection request.

AEP also suggests that RTOs/ISOs that have consolidated their small and large
generator interconnection procedures into a single generator interconnection procedure
should be permitted to propose that all or some smaller-sized generating facilities, such as
20 MW or smaller generating facilities, would be “too small” to need to be included in
the cluster.776
Other commenters believe that any exceptions to the cluster study process
requirement should be very limited.777 NRECA asserts that if the final rule provides for
any interconnection requests to be processed outside the annual cluster study process, it
should be limited to a narrow category of interconnection requests, such as emergency
replacements of failed equipment driven by near-term reliability needs.778 MISO asserts
that there should be very limited exceptions, explaining that it has limited its non-queue
interconnection requests to those that are associated with existing generating facilities
that do not seek to add new or additional interconnection service, or small
interconnection requests.779 Outside of those limited exceptions, MISO states that it does

not support processing any other interconnection requests outside of the interconnection
queue.780
ENGIE recommends that exceptions be limited to requests that “need[] to be
studied outside of the cluster process, e.g., transmission planning and state or public
policy issues.”781 ENGIE states that it is possible that there may be other exceptions
made in emergency situations, in which case, the granting of exceptions should be very
limited in scope, subject to transparent criteria, and the rationale made publicly available.
ENGIE further recommends that every interconnection request, including emergency
requests, enter through the cluster request window, but that an emergency request be
accelerated if it meets the pre-determined and publicly available requirements.
A number of commenters oppose an option to process interconnection requests
outside of the annual cluster study process.782 A few parties argue that maintaining an
option to process interconnection requests outside of the annual cluster study process
would likely create an administrative burden for transmission providers without a clear

outside of the interconnection queue could increase the time needed to complete the
cluster studies or could increase restudies.784
Some commenters express concern that such an option could become overly used
or abused.785 Enel asserts that if interconnection requests could be accepted for
processing outside the annual cluster study process, especially on an individual basis,
there would be a high degree of interest because this would allow interconnection
customers to avoid being allocated the costs of regional upgrades that result from many
cluster studies.786 Bonneville asserts that permitting an interconnection request to be
processed outside of the annual cluster study process would create a “perverse incentive”
for some interconnection customers to forgo the cluster study process to avoid cluster
study requirements.787
OMS states that it has considered the benefits of some sort of a “fast-lane process”
for resources that are more “certain,” like those that have received all necessary permits
and regulatory approvals.788 OMS states that use of such a mechanism may be important
or necessary in the future to address reliability concerns, but OMS explains that it is

neutral on the proposal because bypassing the interconnection queue invites a myriad of
potential unintended consequences that might not outweigh the value OMS otherwise
envisions in this type of mechanism.
PacifiCorp states that the Commission’s proposal on this topic is not clear.789
PacifiCorp states that, if the NOPR refers to an interconnection customer’s ability to
request surplus or provisional interconnection service or an informational interconnection
study, PacifiCorp supports maintaining these options. However, PacifiCorp requests the
Commission clarify that requests for such service will be evaluated in the order that
completed interconnection requests are received. PacifiCorp states that it does not
currently support expanding non-cluster service and study offerings.
Regarding under what time frame and at what priority interconnection requests
should be studied outside of the cluster study process, as compared to any active clusters,
Fervo Energy recommends a 270-day time frame for completion of the study with
secondary priority to the active cluster studies.790

transmission providers’ efforts to efficiently process cluster studies—a point persuasively
argued by commenters.791 A separate set of interconnection studies outside of the cluster
study process could cause transmission providers to divert resources away from cluster
studies and cluster restudies. Such diversion could hinder the transmission provider from
meeting the cluster study and cluster restudy deadlines adopted in this final rule, which
would be insufficient to ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to
the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. We also
find that such an option in the pro forma LGIP would be too open-ended, as it would
leave a significant amount of discretion to the transmission provider to create new study
processes for processing any types of interconnection requests it chooses outside the
cluster study process and could therefore result in a separate but unduly discriminatory
interconnection process. We further find that establishing such an open-ended option in
the pro forma LGIP could create an incentive for some interconnection customers to
forgo the cluster study process, which could increase the time and resources needed for
transmission providers to complete the cluster studies or could increase restudies.792

development, emergency replacements, for certain special circumstances, or for
transmission providers who have too few interconnection requests to justify a cluster
study approach.793 However, we are not persuaded that establishing such processes in the
pro forma LGIP is necessary to ensure that interconnection customers are able to
interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely
manner. We believe that processing such one-off interconnection requests will be needed
less often under the cluster study process adopted in this final rule, and therefore, any
benefits that exist to processing some interconnection requests outside a transmission
provider’s interconnection process may be outweighed by the benefit of allowing
transmission providers to conduct cluster studies efficiently without diverting resources
to a separate set of studies.
In response to the Iowa Commission’s argument that state commissions should be
able to require studies outside of annual cluster studies, we similarly find that any such
studies would divert a transmission provider’s resources away from conducting the
cluster studies and cluster restudies.
Regarding AEP’s suggestion that those RTOs/ISOs that have consolidated their
small and large generator interconnection procedures should be permitted to propose that
all or some smaller-sized generating facilities would be “too small” to be included in the

generating facilities subject to the pro forma SGIP.
Finally, because we are not revising the pro forma LGIP to add a new option for
some interconnection requests to be processed outside of the annual cluster study process,
we find moot those comments on the time frame and priority of interconnection requests
studied outside of the cluster study process.794 In response to PacifiCorp,795 we clarify
that requests for surplus interconnection service, or an optional interconnection study,
will continue to be processed as received and outside of the cluster study process, and
that this does not entail an expansion of non-cluster service and study offerings.

Several commenters argue that the Commission should require transmission
providers to provide more cost information to interconnection customers throughout the

studies should also ensure that interim cost information is made available to
interconnection customers so that they can make more informed decisions earlier in the
interconnection process, which will in turn lead to a more efficient interconnection
process overall.799 Clean Energy Associations argue that as part of the cluster studies
provided to interconnection customers prior to their receiving facilities studies, the
Commission should require transmission providers to provide interconnection customers
with cost estimates for the upgrades required if they were to request ERIS or NRIS (or
long-term firm transmission service), respectively—and coupled with minimum
thresholds for materiality (such as distribution factor) and transparency regarding how
these costs are derived (detailing the assumptions and criteria that will be used).800 Clean

Energy Associations also suggest that the Commission should provide concrete direction
regarding how differing service types should be studied, and what outcome an
interconnection customer should receive for making the necessary transmission system
improvements to obtain that interconnection service.801 AEE similarly believes that
additional reforms are needed to bring more transparency and predictability to
interconnection costs, and without this transparency and predictability, interconnection
customers face continued risks of unjust and unreasonable interconnection study results
that derail or delay interconnection requests and cause increased costs.802
Affected Interconnection Customers state that the Commission should permit
interconnection customers to use independent studies to demonstrate whether the request
for limited interconnection service would result in stability, short circuit, thermal, and/or
voltage issues, if the transmission provider or transmission owner is unable to complete
the studies on time.803 Affected Interconnection Customers argue that allowing
interconnection customers to use any available resources to conduct these studies would
enable already built interconnection facilities to flow power onto the system, as long as
studies show that such interim services will not harm the system.
Clean Energy Associations ask that in a final rule, the Commission adopt a cost

Regarding Affected Interconnection Customers’ arguments discussing the use of
independent studies, we note that interconnection customers can use independent
resources during the interconnection process. However, the results of independent
studies will not be binding on transmission providers, as the use of studies conducted by
an interconnection customer cannot ensure that the cluster study process results in a just,
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential outcome for all interconnection
customers in the cluster. In addition, transmission providers must be able to conduct the
necessary studies to maintain the reliability of their transmission system.
We will not require transmission providers to provide additional cost information
to interconnection customers that is not already required to be provided pursuant to the
pro forma LGIP, as modified by this final rule. For example, revised pro forma LGIP
sections 3.4.5 (Customer Engagement Window) and 8.1 (Interconnection Facilities Study
Agreement) require the transmission provider to provide the interconnection customer
with a good faith estimate of the costs of the cluster study and the interconnection facility
study, respectively. Similarly, revised pro forma LGIP sections 7.3 (Scope of Cluster
Study) and 8.2 (Scope of Interconnection Facilities Study) require the transmission
provider to provide cost estimates for interconnection facilities and network upgrades. It
is unclear what other “interim cost information”808 Clean Energy Associations want
transmission providers to provide, nor the value of such information vis-à-vis the burden
on transmission providers to develop it.

Clean Energy Associations argue that as part of the cluster studies provided to
interconnection customers prior to receiving facilities studies, the Commission should
require transmission providers to provide interconnection customers with cost estimates
for the upgrades required if they were to request ERIS or NRIS. Section 3.2 of the pro
forma LGIP provides that an interconnection customer requesting NRIS may also request
that it be concurrently studied for ERIS, up to the point when the facility study agreement
is executed. As the pro forma LGIP already provides interconnection customers the
ability to have both ERIS and NRIS studied concurrently, we find Clean Energy
Associations’ request moot.

Allocation of Cluster Study Costs
a.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require transmission providers to
allocate the shared costs of cluster studies as follows: 90% of the applicable study costs
allocated pro rata to interconnection customers based on requested MWs included in the
applicable cluster, and 10% of the applicable study costs allocated per capita to
interconnection customers based on the number of interconnection requests included in
the applicable cluster.809 The Commission preliminarily found that this allocation of the
costs of cluster studies would result in just and reasonable Commission-jurisdictional
rates because it appropriately recognizes that the MW size of a cluster has a dramatic
impact on the cost of studying the cluster, while also recognizing that the number of

interconnection requests included in the cluster also impacts the cost of studying the
cluster, but to a lesser degree. The Commission sought comment on whether a different
cost allocation approach may be appropriate or whether each transmission provider
should be provided additional flexibility to propose a cost allocation approach on
compliance with any final rule.810

study cost allocation based on the Commission’s cost causation principle.814 Duke
Southeast Utilities assert that the proposed allocation aligns with study deposits that
would be submitted based on varying assumptions around the number and size of
interconnection requests submitted into the cluster study process.
ii.

Comments in Opposition

Several commenters oppose the proposal. For instance, National Grid and
NRECA argue that any predetermined study cost allocation method will produce results
that do not comport with cost causation.815 National Grid gives the example of a 20 MW
generating facility that has unique or complex engineering features at a particular point of
interconnection that may require considerably more time to conduct a study than a much
larger 100 MW generating facility; in this situation, according to National Grid, the 90/10
cost allocation methodology proposed in the NOPR would not align with cost causation,
a problem that would be exacerbated if the interconnection customer withdraws the
interconnection request.816 National Grid asserts that a predetermined cost allocation
risks undermining competitive pressures in the interconnection process, which it states
should be retained to the maximum extent possible consistent with revisions to mitigate
the existing interconnection queue inefficiencies. Similarly, Xcel and NextEra argue that
the size of the interconnection request does not impact the study costs by a 9:1 ratio

compared to the number of interconnection requests, noting that the size of the
interconnection request does not materially impact the time to add the generating facility
to the model or time to design the interconnecting substation.817 NRECA adds that the
Commission has not produced data showing the fixed costs of processing an
interconnection request or a precise linear correlation between generating facility size and
study costs.818 rPlus argues that the proposed 90/10 cost allocation is “unduly
discriminatory toward pumped storage, and wholly disincentivizes large capacity
projects.”819 rPlus argues that the assertion that the MW size of a cluster study is
significantly more impactful on the cost and effort required to perform the study is
incorrect. rPlus states that the number of interconnection requests and the cluster size are
both burdensome for the study process, as each generating facility requires its own
project management, technical review, study implementation, and deliverability
assessment.820 SDG&E and SoCal Edison agree that a 90/10 cost allocation would
inappropriately burden larger generating facilities with higher study costs, as the level of
effort to study an interconnection request is driven more by complexity around the point
of interconnection and is not strongly correlated to the size of the generating facility.821

Alternatives and Requests for Flexibility

Several commenters put forth alternatives to the NOPR proposal. For instance,
some commenters generally contend that transmission providers should allocate study
costs based on the proposed generating facility’s impact on the overall study, measured
by the time and resources expended on a particular generating facility within the study.822
National Grid asserts that this process would be consistent with the current serial study
approach, which directly correlates cost responsibility to cost causation.823 AES argues
that the final rule’s cost allocation framework should reflect the reality that study costs
are not only a function of generating facility size, but also the location of the generating
facility and the degree to which that location is constrained.824
Several commenters argue that the Commission should allocate cluster study costs
based solely on the number of interconnection requests in the cluster.825 Ameren and
SDG&E state that, in their experience, study costs are not based on the size of the
proposed generating facilities.826 In contrast, Fervo Energy argues against allocating study
costs evenly to all interconnection customers within a cluster, asserting that it is “not at all

clear” how this proposal is just and reasonable, as it strays away from allocating costs on a
pro rata basis based on requested MWs.827
CAISO argues that the proposal appears arbitrary and capricious because the
Commission does not adequately explain the basis for the 90% to 10% ratio.828 CAISO
asserts that the 10% allocation is so small as to be de minimis, yet it still increases the
administrative burden to allocate the cluster study costs. CAISO argues that it would be
much simpler and easier if transmission providers simply allocated all cluster study costs
based on the MW capacity alone.
Enel argues that there are study phases where it would be more appropriate to
assign study costs to individual interconnection requests, “such as the [f]acilities [s]tudy
for upgrades assigned to only a single customer.”829 Enel argues that a 90/10 study cost
split may disproportionately exclude very small generating facilities which still require
modeling from study cost responsibility, and suggests that a minimum MW size be
assumed, such as was used to set the minimum study deposit in proposed pro forma LGIP
section 3.1.1.1.
Several commenters argue for a cost allocation of 50% of the study costs based on
requested MW and 50% based on the number of interconnection requests in the cluster.830

NextEra states that, based on its experience, it takes comparable time and effort to study a
small proposed generating facility as a large one.831 NextEra and SoCal Edison argue
that allocating study costs based mostly on the MW size would likely cause some crosssubsidies from interconnection customers submitting large proposed generating facilities
to those submitting smaller ones.832 SEIA notes that the MW size of the cluster may be
artificially inflated when certain interconnection customers submit multiple exploratory
requests, and recommends a 50/50 cost allocation to deter such requests.833 SEIA argues
that, similar to CAISO’s study cost allocation, the Commission should structure the cost
allocation so that interconnection customers with multiple interconnection requests are
responsible for a greater share of the study costs.834
Clean Energy Associations add that cluster studies should be conducted in
subgroups based on electrical relevance, and that study costs related to each subgroup
should be tracked independently and allocated only among those interconnection
customers within that subgroup.835

Multiple commenters argue that the Commission should not impose a specific
cluster study cost allocation, but instead allow transmission providers flexibility in
proposing their own cost allocation methods.836 For example, APPA-LPPC argue that the
use of a “one-size-fits-all” approach may result in unreasonable results in certain
circumstances.837 APPA-LPPC assert that weighting the allocation of cluster study costs
based on MWs may unfairly burden interconnection customers proposing large
generating facilities in regions where a cluster is likely to include a large number of
relatively small proposed generating facilities and a small number of large proposed
generating facilities because study costs do not necessarily track linearly with generating
facility size.
Several commenters argue that RTOs/ISOs should be able to retain their existing
cluster study cost allocations, where applicable, because those cost allocations
accomplish the purpose of the Commission’s proposal to equitably allocate study costs
among interconnection customers.838

- 283 Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to revise section 13.3
(Obligation for Study Costs) of the pro forma LGIP to allow each transmission provider
to propose its own study cost allocation ratio for allocating the shared costs of cluster
studies between a per capita basis and pro rata by MW, provided that: between 10% and
50% of study costs must be allocated on a per capita basis, with the remainder (between
90% and 50%) allocated pro rata by MW. Under this revised provision, a transmission
provider may propose to retain its existing study cost allocation ratio if it falls within this
range and meets the requirements of this final rule.
We are persuaded by comments arguing that it is appropriate to allow transmission
providers a degree of flexibility in proposing on compliance the method for allocating
study costs in their tariff to adapt to their specific regional circumstances and help avoid
unreasonable outcomes. Some commenters assert that the NOPR-proposed 90%-10%
allocation could in some instances unduly burden larger generating facilities, such as
when a cluster includes a large number of interconnection requests representing relatively
small generating facilities and a small number of large generating facilities.839

90%-10% allocation could disproportionately burden smaller generating facilities, given
the role that size may play in determining study costs.840 Accordingly, we believe that
granting transmission providers the flexibility to propose in their tariff the study cost
allocation appropriate to their region, within the limits detailed above, strikes a better
balance than the NOPR proposal.
The revised study cost allocation requirements that we adopt in this final rule
recognize that cluster study costs are impacted by both the number of interconnection
requests in a cluster and the size of the proposed generating facilities in each cluster. We
find that requiring transmission providers to allocate between 10% and 50% of cluster
study costs on a per capita basis is just and reasonable because it ensures that
interconnection customers that propose smaller generating facilities or submit multiple
interconnection requests to explore different interconnection scenarios for a single
proposed generator adequately contribute to study costs, particularly given that some
study costs are incurred independent of the MW size of a specific proposed generating
facility in a cluster.841 Further, we agree with commenters that observe that not all study
costs track linearly with generating facility size because there are other factors, such as
the point of interconnection selected, that can lead to increasingly complex studies and

correspondingly higher study costs.842 We believe that the per capita component of the
study cost allocation requirements addresses this fact. Requiring a per capita component
also ensures that an interconnection customer that proposes a large generating facility in a
cluster of many smaller generating facilities will not bear a disproportionate amount of
the study costs. We likewise find that requiring transmission providers to allocate
between 50% and 90% of study costs on a pro rata by MW basis prevents a
disproportionate amount of study costs from being allocated to interconnection customers
that propose smaller generating facilities in the cluster. The pro rata by MW component
reflects the fact that, to a significant extent, study costs correlate to the total MW size of
the cluster. In general, even if the number of interconnection requests in each cluster
remains constant, we expect that a cluster of 10,000 MW will be significantly more costly
to study than a cluster of 100 MW.843 Accordingly, requiring that a substantial share of
study costs is allocated based on each generating facility’s contribution to the total MW
size of the cluster study ensures consistency with cost causation principles.
We disagree with CAISO that the Commission should require the allocation of all
cluster study costs based on the MW capacity because allocating 10% of study costs on a
per capita basis is de minimis and not worth the administrative burden. First, this final
rule now allows transmission providers to allocate up to 50% of costs on a per capita

basis. Even if a transmission provider chooses to allocate only 10% of study costs on a
per capita basis, as explained above, we believe that this is an important component that
is needed to ensure that study costs are allocated in a manner that is at least roughly
commensurate with estimated benefits (i.e., consistent with cost causation). We are
unpersuaded that the administrative burden associated with allocating a potentially small
fraction of the study costs among interconnection customers in a cluster outweighs the
benefits, particularly given that nothing in the record demonstrates that those
administrative costs are significant.
In response to commenters’ arguments in favor of a uniform study cost allocation
method across regions, we find that the benefits of allowing transmission providers
flexibility to tailor their study cost allocation to the specific circumstances of their region
outweigh the benefits of uniformity cited by commenters, such as consistency and
preventing “shopping around.” We believe that the guardrails that we provide in this
final rule will ensure just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential rates
while at the same time addressing concerns with the different characteristics of regions.
We urge stakeholders to engage with transmission providers as part of the compliance
process as the transmission providers develop their proposed study cost allocations.
In response to National Grid, AES, and Clean Energy Associations’ comments
arguing that costs should be allocated based on individual calculations of the actual time
and resources expended on a particular interconnection request, we find that such
individual calculations would not only increase the administrative burden on transmission
providers, but also would offer little benefit given the cluster study context, which

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 287 -

requires transmission providers to evaluate multiple interconnection requests
simultaneously.844 We are also unconvinced that a transmission provider could
accurately perform such calculations because, as explained above, some study costs are
unrelated to an individual interconnection request and are instead incurred as a matter of
course as part of studying a cluster of interconnection requests.

Allocation of Cluster Network Upgrade Costs
a.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require transmission providers to
allocate network upgrade costs to interconnection customers within a cluster using a
proportional impact method.845 The Commission also proposed to add the defined term
proportional impact method to the pro forma LGIP and require transmission providers to
revise their LGIPs to include the specific technical parameters and thresholds of their
method for cost allocation. The Commission also proposed to require transmission
providers to allocate the costs of transmission provider’s interconnection facilities equally
among all interconnection customers sharing use of the transmission provider’s
interconnection facilities. The Commission sought comment on: (1) whether there are
specific types of analyses that the Commission should require transmission providers to
use to determine the proportional impact attributed to an interconnection request,

including the benefits and drawbacks of any proposed approach; (2) whether there are
specific types of analyses that the Commission should prohibit because they are known to
be inaccurate, provide undue discretion to the transmission provider, or could otherwise
be problematic; (3) whether alternative methods to allocate the costs of network upgrades
within a cluster, such as the proportional capacity method, can be sufficiently accurate in
certain instances, in a manner consistent with or superior to the proposed method; and
(4) whether there are some circumstances where the proportional capacity method would
not be appropriate, such as circumstances where there may be potential for discriminatory
treatment.846

customer contributes to the cost of network upgrades in proportion to its impact on the
transmission system.849 These commenters assert that other options (such as a
proportional capacity or a pro rata allocation per interconnection request) would be more
likely to shift a disproportionate share of network upgrade costs to smaller generating
facilities, which may have less impact on the transmission system.850 Bonneville and
Interwest argue that the proportional impact method could also reduce the incentive for
interconnection customers to submit multiple speculative requests and reduce the amount
of cascading withdrawals and restudies.851 ELCON contends that, should any one
proposed generating facility in the cluster have an outsized impact on the transmission
system compared to other proposed generating facilities in the cluster, those other
proposed generating facilities should be protected from exorbitant network upgrade costs

to accommodate a proposed generating facility that may not be suitably located.852
CAISO adds that it has used distribution factor analysis without controversy.853
NRECA states that it interprets this proposal to implement—and not modify,
weaken, or permit deviations from—the Commission’s established policy that
transmission costs, including network upgrade costs, must be allocated in a manner at
least reasonably commensurate with estimated benefits.854 NRECA states that, based on
that interpretation of the NOPR’s proposal, NRECA believes this method is fair to both
interconnection customers and transmission providers and helps ensure that the costs to
implement an interconnection request are allocated reasonably commensurate with cost
causation and expected benefits. NRECA states that the proportional impact method is
also reasonably transparent and relatively easy for transmission providers to implement,
explain, and defend.
In response to the Commission’s request for comment on whether there are
circumstances in which the proportional capacity method would be appropriate, some
commenters argue that the proportional capacity method is never appropriate and should
be expressly prohibited for clusters.855 MISO argues that network upgrade cost allocation

methods that only consider installed capacity without considering the network topology
do not consider the full picture of what an interconnection customer’s responsibility for
the network upgrade costs should be.856 Pennsylvania Commission asserts that large
generating facilities would continue to bear high network upgrade costs and would have
an incentive to interconnect wisely, while small generating facilities, which are becoming
the norm in interconnection queues, would not.857 Pennsylvania Commission contends
that this would create a subsidy whereby large generating facilities pay a share of
unnecessary network upgrade costs caused by poor siting of smaller generating
facilities.858 Longroad Energy illustrates this point by noting that one of its generating
facilities was recently allocated nearly $10 million under the proportional capacity
method based solely on the generating facility’s size, despite the fact that relevant
interconnection studies firmly established that its generating facility, while large, actually
reduced the identified overload.859
NV Energy urges the Commission to reconsider the application of pro rata
allocation of network upgrade costs over using the proportional impact method.860 NV

interconnection customers due to the time and risk of reallocations required by
restudies.861 NV Energy argues that assigned network upgrade costs could change
dramatically if a cluster participant withdraws from the interconnection queue and
requires a restudy, potentially resulting in each participant’s cost allocation changing.862
NV Energy asserts that in addition to disintegrating cost reassurance for the
interconnection customer, performing studies using the proportional impact method
defeats the purpose of completing cluster studies where each interconnection customer in
the cluster has the same interconnection queue position and that this method will require
the transmission provider to review each interconnection request within the cluster
individually to assign the proportional impact.
NV Energy contends that using the proportional impact method to allocate the
costs of network upgrades resulting from cluster studies will be burdensome in
application because of the volume of interconnection requests being studied and the large
number of network upgrades identified in each study.863 NV Energy states that, under a
proportional capacity method, when an interconnection customer withdraws and the same
network upgrades are deemed necessary, the transmission provider could simply
reallocate a pro rata share to the remaining interconnection customers and expedite the
study; however, in the case of the proportional impact method, the transmission provider

would need to complete a full restudy to review each generating facility’s impact on the
system.
According to NV Energy, this issue is further exacerbated when a network
upgrade becomes a shared network upgrade with another cluster and the proportional
impact is expanded to include additional interconnection customers.864 NV Energy states
that, not only would the restudy be required for the lower-queued cluster based on the
withdrawal, but also the concurrently queued cluster to modify the network upgrade cost
allocation. NV Energy also argues that, without a consistent proportional impact cost
allocation amongst transmission providers, there is risk that this could lead to disputes at
the Commission from interconnection customers, which would lead to increased costs
and delays.
PacifiCorp strongly opposes the proportional impact method to allocate network
upgrade costs.865 PacifiCorp argues that the Commission has not made a transmission
provider-specific finding that the proportional capacity method, approved for PacifiCorp
by the Commission in May 2020,866 is no longer just and reasonable. PacifiCorp
contends that transmission providers should be permitted to use proportional capacitybased network upgrade cost allocation methods.867 PacifiCorp claims that the

proportional capacity method it uses is informed by three additional mechanisms within
the cluster study process, all of which work in tandem to ensure that costs are
appropriately allocated: (1) the use of electrically or geographically relevant subregions;
(2) iterative studies that consider ERIS network upgrades prior to NRIS requests; and
(3) a floor of 1% of total MW within a cluster, under which interconnection requests will
be deemed not to contribute to the network upgrades identified in the cluster study.868
PacifiCorp states that the proportional capacity method also assists it in
completing cluster studies and restudies on a timely basis, and minimizes disputes.869
PacifiCorp argues that, in sharp contrast, the proportional impact method involves a
complex analysis that, in addition to being excessively time consuming, will result in
disputes, both of which will put substantial pressure on PacifiCorp’s ability to meet study
deadlines.870 Therefore, according to PacifiCorp, requiring use of the proportional impact
method will be counterproductive to the Commission’s intent of making processing of
interconnection requests more efficient.
PacifiCorp explains that the degree of contribution to a needed network upgrade
can be very difficult to determine depending on the size, number of interconnection
requests, and location of proposed generating facilities in a cluster.871 PacifiCorp adds

that a proportional impact method analysis is complicated further by the fact that all
interconnection requests within a single cluster are considered equally queued. In
addition, PacifiCorp argues that, given the size of its multi-state system and the thousands
of MWs of interconnection requests entering the cluster study process each year,872 it is
simply not possible to both perform a proportional impact method analysis on each
interconnection request and complete the cluster study process within 150 calendar
days.873

Comments on Specific Proposal
(a)

Specificity Regarding Technical Parameters
and Thresholds

Several commenters state that, if the Commission adopts its proposal for each
transmission provider to revise its tariff to include its specific technical parameters and
thresholds for the proportional impact method for network upgrade cost allocation, the
Commission should at least consider guidance or principles for those technical
parameters and thresholds.874 The same commenters ask that the Commission also
require sufficient specificity to provide transparency and certainty for potential
interconnection customers and to avoid disputes over cost allocation.

872

PacifiCorp states that during the most recent cluster study, which commenced
in May 2022, PacifiCorp received around 40 GW-worth of interconnection requests,
which is more than three times PacifiCorp’s peak system load.

EPSA and Vistra argue that the Commission should provide an opportunity for
comments prior to moving to a final rule with more detailed parameters.875 Vistra
contends that without such an opportunity, the Commission will have not provided
sufficient notice.876 Vistra argues that adopting a final rule that contains only the very
high-level requirement to allocate costs based on proportional impact method simply
defers the Commission’s determination on important implementation details to litigation
over the individual compliance filings that will be submitted. Without sufficient detail,
Vistra continues, the Commission will arguably need to accept any set of technical details
as in compliance with the requirement to allocate network upgrade costs based on
proportional impact.
PPL states that the NOPR did not address the allocation of network upgrade costs
within a cluster after an interconnection customer withdraws.877 PPL states that, prior to
the execution of an interconnection agreement by the interconnection customer(s), the
Commission should provide that any interconnection facility and network upgrade costs
previously allocated to the withdrawing interconnection customer be reallocated among
the remaining interconnection customers in the cluster to prevent delays and allow the
study process to proceed. PPL states that the Commission should allow for withdrawal to
be treated as an event that allows the transmission provider to retain or call on the

security provided by the withdrawing interconnection customer. PPL adds that the
Commission should allow for an increase in the cost allocated to remaining
interconnection customers in a cluster to account for the amount previously allocated to
the withdrawing interconnection customer.
(b)

Tariff Requirement for Technical Details

PJM states that, while it generally supports the requirement to describe the cost
allocation method in the applicable tariff, the Commission should clarify that
transmission providers may provide the detailed and specific technical information in
business practice manuals rather than in tariffs.878 PJM states that these types of
implementation details change from time to time and, consistent with Commission
precedent, are appropriately addressed in the transmission provider’s manuals. PJM
asserts that mandating that these procedures be placed in the transmission provider’s
tariff, on the other hand, would require a transmission provider to submit an FPA section
205 filing every time the implementation details changed, which would be inefficient and
burdensome.
In contrast, other commenters argue that these thresholds, and any associated
procedures, should be codified in transmission providers’ tariffs.879 AES explains that
the thresholds used as part of the proportional impact method are important planning

criteria, and constitute “practices that affect rates and services significantly, that are
realistically susceptible of specification and that are not so generally understood as to
render recitation superfluous;” accordingly, AES continues, they should be included in
transmission providers’ filed rates, and subject to review and approval by the
Commission pursuant to section 205 of the FPA.880 Union of Concerned Scientists
contends that the combination of issues that are expressed through network upgrade
decisions and cost allocations for interconnection customers are arguably central to this
rulemaking and the fulfillment of the competition amongst interconnection customers as
a regulatory approach to setting wholesale energy prices and must be subject to notice
and review, both initially and for any subsequent changes, through filings with the
Commission.881
Xcel states that the Commission should make clear that there are several just and
reasonable approaches to allocating network upgrade costs to interconnection customers
within a cluster.882 For example, states Xcel, if two generating facilities are connecting to
a new a transmission line, a substation must be constructed. Xcel explains that, using
some analysis, a larger generating facility might be considered to have a larger impact,
but the respective size of the interconnection request did not have any impact on the cost

or size of the substation needed. Xcel states that, for example, the cost of the substation
is not different for a 100 MW and 500 MW generating facility or for two 300 MW
generating facilities if they are interconnecting at the same voltage, and as a result, the
cost of that substation should be allocated equally to both generating facilities. Xcel
states that there could be a third generating facility (not directly connected to the
substation) from which the power flows through the new substation, but it is not clear if
the Commission is proposing that the interconnection customer proposing that third
generating facility pays for a portion of the substation costs because its flows “impact”
the substation. Xcel states that it does not generally support allocating network upgrade
costs to interconnection customers simply because their proposed generating facilities
have a flow impact if they are not causing the need for the network upgrade under a “but
for” evaluation.
Invenergy states that, in the occasional circumstance where a point of
interconnection is shared among more than one interconnection request within a cluster,
which could involve new equipment that does not vary based on proportional impact, the
associated costs at the point of interconnection (e.g., the substation) could be allocated on
a pro rata basis.883 PacifiCorp states that the proportional impact method would not be
necessary to account for costs that are agnostic to interconnection customer impacts, such

as the need to construct a new substation to connect to a new transmission line regardless
of whether one or several generating facilities are interconnecting.884
Invenergy states that the NOPR could be read to permit each transmission provider
to adopt different and possibly inconsistent analyses and that the Commission should be
clear that it is requiring a proportional impact method for allocating network upgrade
costs, just as the NOPR proposes to do with respect to shared network upgrades.885
Several commenters state that the final rule should require transmission providers
to submit compliance filings that propose minimum distribution factor thresholds that
will be used to evaluate NRIS and ERIS requests.886
(c)

Requests for Flexibility

Some commenters support the proportional capacity method only for certain
network upgrades or limited circumstances.

approach; rather, Tri-State uses a MW pro rata method approach when allocating the

costs of transient-stability-driven network upgrades.887 Longroad Energy states that, to
the extent the Commission allows a transmission provider to use some method other than
a flow-based proportional impact allocation for transient stability constraints, the
transmission provider should be required to demonstrate that the alternative cost
allocation method is based on sound engineering principles for the specific transient
stability constraint observed in the studies.888
R Street states that allocating network upgrade costs based on proportional
capacity is appropriate in situations where clusters are composed of similar types of
generation.889 R Street asserts that the default should be that all thermal network upgrade
cost allocations are based on proportional capacity. R Street states that this leaves open
the possibility for transmission providers to allocate other types of network upgrade costs
(voltage, transient stability, short circuit) using a different but predefined method.
Several commenters ask the Commission to provide flexibility for transmission
providers to establish a cost allocation method for network upgrades, rather than
mandating a prescriptive approach.890 PPL claims that such region-specific cost

allocations are necessary to keep disputes from overwhelming the reform process the
Commission anticipates.891 New York State Department asserts that any strict or limiting
requirement for a specific cost allocation method may undermine and replace existing
processes that work well.892 National Grid recommends that the Commission allow for
consideration of the unique circumstances of a region, input from relevant stakeholders in
the region, including the potential for regions to propose cost allocation methods that
allow for broader allocation to load or transmission customers in addition to
interconnection customers.893
Dominion points out that courts and the Commission have long recognized that
there is not one single just and reasonable method for establishing cost allocation.894
Dominion states that rather, cost allocation proposals are reviewed to determine whether
they meet certain principles, chiefly that costs are allocated in a manner that is at least
“roughly commensurate” with estimated benefits received.895 Accordingly, Dominion
recommends that if the Commission imposes any requirements related to cost allocation,

Pattern Energy generally supports the application of the proportional impact
method, subject to clarification on which form of distribution factor analysis the
Commission is contemplating.897 Pattern Energy states that there are two types of
distribution factors used to determine the impact of given power injection flows over a
monitored facility: (1) power transfer distribution factor, which is the percentage of
power that will flow on a specific monitored facility and does not consider
outage/contingent facilities; and (2) outage transfer distribution factor, which is the
percentage of power that will flow on a specific facility that does consider
outage/contingent facilities. Pattern Energy states that the difference between the two
distribution factors (i.e., the consideration of the outage/contingent facility) is important
because power transfer distribution factor is usually more relevant for evaluating “local
impacts” (e.g., generating facilities that are connecting in very close electrical proximity
to a given monitored element), compared to outage transfer distribution factor, which
captures impacts that may be more geographically and electrically distant from a given
monitored facility. Pattern Energy asserts that the Commission should require outage
transfer distribution factor to be the required distribution factor utilized in the

proportional impact method for identifying impacts to constrained facilities and resultant
cost allocation for network upgrades. Pattern Energy argues that outage transfer
distribution factor is a better measure of power flows on the bulk-power system, and, in
turn, its use ensures that impacts to constrained facilities are properly mitigated by, and
cost allocated to, the actual, full set of contributors and not just the nearby highest
contributors.
Pine Gate contends that certain proposed enhancements to the NOPR proposal
would provide much needed certainty to interconnection customers and mitigate the
systematic problem of interconnection queues being the primary mechanism by which
needed transmission infrastructure is identified, developed, and constructed.898
Specifically, Pine Gate requests that the Commission make the following clarifications:
(1) transmission providers are not permitted to allocate to interconnection customers
network upgrade costs associated with preexisting operating conditions (such as
overloads); (2) transmission providers are not permitted to allocate network upgrade costs
to interconnection customers for loading that results from the simulation of conditions
that do not reflect typical operating conditions; (3) transmission providers are required to
use consistent, uniform thresholds to measure the impact on a specific transmission
facility caused by an interconnection request and publish these thresholds, along with the
corresponding scope of the resulting network upgrades; and (4) establish a 4% impact
threshold for NRIS and a 20% impact threshold for ERIS, unless there is preexisting

loading on the facility.899 Pine Gate further requests that the Commission provide
transmission providers guidance on the scope of the network upgrade required to
accommodate an interconnection request. Pine Gate states that, if a network upgrade
benefits other types of customers, interconnection customers should receive transmission
credits or other compensation if the additional transmission capacity created is used for
market dispatch or by wholesale transmission customers.900 Pine Gate states that, if the
Commission does not adopt Pine Gate’s proposed enhancements as part of a final rule in
this proceeding, then the Commission should establish a technical conference to explore
these issues.

Miscellaneous

Pennsylvania Commission states that limiting the scope of each cluster to those
interconnection customers most likely to share the same network upgrades may reduce
the need for the proportional impact network upgrade cost allocation method.901
According to Pennsylvania Commission, instead of determining the degree to which
interconnection requests cause specific network upgrades on the back end through cost
allocation, clustering by electrical relevance may accomplish the same goal, making sure
that interconnection customers are sharing the costs of network upgrades that they cause
and from which they benefit. Pennsylvania Commission contends that the Commission

should examine whether limiting the scope of a cluster or cost allocation, or a
combination of both, is the best method to share costs among interconnection customers
causing the same network upgrades.
Several commenters state that the NOPR leaves unresolved the fundamental
question of more equitably sharing network upgrade costs across all beneficiaries,
including load.902 They argue, for example, that policies requiring interconnection
customers to pay for 100% of network upgrade costs when the benefits of those upgrades
are distributed among other system users (i.e., participant funding) causes interconnection
customers to pay more than their appropriate share of the costs.903 In contrast, Ameren
claims that it is appropriate for interconnection customers to bear responsibility for the
cost of network upgrades required for their interconnection requests.904 Ameren argues
that, to ensure the full costs of interconnection are identified and allocated, network
upgrade costs associated with affected systems must also be included in cluster network
upgrade cost allocation, and interconnection customers should be required to accept the
assigned costs. Ohio Commission Consumer Advocate emphasizes that the Commission

PPL argues that the Commission should allow non-RTO/ISO transmission providers the
option to propose allocating the costs of network upgrades to interconnection customers
without credits as RTOs/ISOs do.906
New York State Department and Shell argue that the Commission should
discontinue the historical practice of allowing interconnection customers essentially free
use of headroom on ratepayer-funded network facilities.907 New York State Department
states that this occurs when transmission ratepayers fund upgrades to the transmission
system that create headroom, from which interconnection customers later benefit without
having to pay for access or use.908 In contrast, Invenergy asserts that the Commission
needs to ensure that the transmission planning and interconnection models are consistent,
so that interconnection customers are not required to pay for the cost of resolving
overloads and other transmission system issues that exist without the proposed
interconnection.909

AEE encourages the Commission to ensure that its proposal increases cost
transparency and establishes a pathway for interconnection customers to access accurate
information about their network upgrade costs in a timely manner.910 For instance, AEE
asks that the Commission also provide guidance regarding which party must pay if
network upgrade costs significantly exceed estimates. AEE states that one approach to
minimizing the construction time and cost of network upgrades, and consequently the
interconnection process as a whole, is to provide a third-party construction option in the
pro forma LGIA that would allow the interconnection customer to elect for stand alone
network upgrades to be bid out and potentially built by third parties.911
Pine Gate recommends that the Commission require transmission providers to
analyze more holistically the other underlying needs driving identified network upgrades
to the transmission system.912 Pine Gate states that the Commission should require
transmission providers to only allocate to interconnection customers the costs associated
with accelerating the construction of the upgrade to accommodate the interconnection
customer’s anticipated commercial operation date.913

- 309 Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modifications, to add new proposed section
4.2.3, now section 4.2.1, to the pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers to
allocate network upgrade costs based on a proportional impact method.914 Based on the
record, we modify the NOPR proposal and add definitions for substation network
upgrades and system network upgrades in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA. In
addition, we modify the definitions of proportional impact method and stand alone
network upgrades proposed in the NOPR. We also modify proposed section 4.2.1 of the
pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers to allocate the costs of network
upgrades located at substations equally among each generating facility interconnecting to
the same substation (i.e., on a per capita basis), and to revise the information that a
transmission provider’s tariff must include regarding the proportional impact method.
We also modify the requirement in proposed section 4.2.1 of the pro forma LGIP
for transmission providers to directly assign the cost of shared transmission provider’s
interconnection facilities to interconnection customers on a per capita basis (i.e., on a per
generating facility basis). Specifically, we modify proposed section 4.2.1 of the pro
forma LGIP to make the new provisions applicable to the interconnection customer’s
interconnection facilities as well as to the transmission provider’s interconnection

914

“Proportional Impact Method shall mean a technical analysis conducted by
Transmission Provider to determine the degree to which each Generating Facility in the
Cluster Study contributes to the need for a specific System Network Upgrade.” Pro

facilities. We also modify this section to provide that interconnection customers may
agree to share interconnection facilities, and that the per capita allocation will apply only
where interconnection customers agree to share interconnection facilities. We also
modify this section to allow the interconnection customers that share interconnection
facilities to choose a different cost sharing arrangement upon mutual agreement.
We find that adopting the modified NOPR proposal will ensure just and
reasonable rates as transmission providers transition to the cluster study process required
by this final rule. We find that the cost allocation method adopted herein will allow
transmission providers to allocate network upgrade costs among several interconnection
customers that may benefit from (and cause the need for) certain network upgrades. We
also find that allocating shared network upgrade costs among a cluster of interconnection
customers will reduce the frequency of an individual interconnection customer being
allocated the costs of a large network upgrade that benefits subsequent interconnection
customers; reduce the incentive of interconnection customers to submit multiple
speculative interconnection requests to avoid shouldering the cost of large network
upgrades that may be triggered by a single interconnection customer in the existing serial
study process; and reduce the number of cascading withdrawals and restudies, thereby
improving the efficiency of the interconnection process and reducing interconnection
queue processing delays.
We conclude that a proportional impact method appropriately reflects the
Commission’s interconnection pricing policy for facilities designated as network
upgrades needed for the interconnection of the cluster. However, we are persuaded to

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 311 -

adopt a different cost allocation method for substations at the point of interconnection
that are designated as network upgrades and needed only to facilitate the interconnection
of certain generating facilities within the cluster seeking interconnection to the specific
substation, as demonstrated by commenters.915
In Order No. 2003, the Commission reasoned that “it is appropriate for the
Interconnection Customer to pay the initial full cost for Interconnection Facilities and
Network Upgrades that would not be needed but for the interconnection” (i.e., “but for”
policy).916 Hence, under the serial study process in the existing pro forma LGIP, the
transmission provider allocates network upgrade costs by assigning the initial full cost
responsibility for all network upgrades identified in a study to a single interconnection
customer that causes those upgrades. However, in transitioning to a cluster study process
in this final rule, the Commission must establish a method for allocating network upgrade
costs among all interconnection customers within a cluster. Based on the record in this
proceeding, we find that a proportional impact method is the appropriate application of
the Commission’s interconnection pricing policy when allocating the costs of network
upgrades needed for an entire cluster of proposed generating facilities because a
proportional impact method allows transmission providers to assess a generating

(describing the cost allocation requirements for network upgrades as the Commission’s
Order No. 2003 “but for requirements”).

facility’s individual contribution to the need for the network upgrades identified for the
cluster. However, the need for substation network upgrades is only generated by a
specific generating facility seeking interconnection at a specific substation and not by all
the generating facilities in the cluster. It would be inconsistent with the Commission’s
interconnection pricing policy to allocate the costs of the substation network upgrades to
interconnection customers in the cluster that are interconnecting at other substations
because, in the case of a cluster of new interconnection requests, only the generating
facilities interconnecting to the same substation generate the need for network upgrades
at that substation.
As explained above, the cost of substation network upgrades must be initially
allocated only to those interconnection customers seeking to interconnect at the same
substation,917 while the cost of system network upgrades for all interconnection
customers in a cluster must be initially allocated based on the technical analyses to be
specified under the transmission provider’s proportional impact method. To facilitate
these differing cost allocation methods, we modify the definitions in section 1 of the pro
forma LGIP and article 1 of the pro forma LGIA to distinguish substation network

917

For clarity, we note that we are referring to the transmission provider’s
substation immediately beyond the point of interconnection as defined in section 1 of the
pro forma LGIP: “Point of Interconnection shall mean the point . . . where the
interconnection facilities connect to the transmission provider's transmission system.”
Pro forma LGIP section 1 (Definitions).

upgrades (including all switching stations)918 from system network upgrades.919 Using
these definitions, we further modify the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA to draw
this distinction and to ensure that the costs for the two types of network upgrades are
allocated consistent with the Commission’s interconnection pricing policy, which
establishes the principles for allocating the costs of network upgrades.
We note that we are not modifying the pro forma LGIP’s definition of facilities
needed beyond the point of interconnection as network upgrades; rather, we are providing
greater specificity with regard to how the costs of the two distinct types of network
upgrades identified within a cluster study should be initially allocated. We find that this
approach will also lead to greater transparency and ease of administering the cluster study
process by establishing distinct guidelines for how the costs of the two types of network
upgrades will be initially allocated within a cluster. Also, as commenters note, in
instances where a point of interconnection is shared among more than one
interconnection request within a cluster, the cost of the substation network upgrades is
more directly impacted by the number of generating facilities proposing to interconnect
there because the cost of the equipment used to interconnect generating facilities to
substations does not vary based on the electrical characteristics of the interconnecting

generating facilities (e.g., the MW size of the generating facility, fuel type, or services
provided).
To further implement this modification of the NOPR proposal, we modify the
definition of stand alone network upgrades proposed in the NOPR to recognize that (1) a
substation network upgrade may only be considered a stand alone network upgrade if it is
needed to interconnect only one generating facility in the cluster and no other
interconnection customer in that cluster is required to interconnect to the same substation
network upgrades, and (2) the proportional impact analysis will be used in determining
whether a system network upgrade is only needed for one generating facility in the
cluster and can be considered a stand alone network upgrade. Our revisions also seek to
prevent lengthy disputes over which interconnection customer has the right to exercise
the option to build in instances where a network upgrade could qualify under the existing
definition of a stand alone network upgrade, but the network upgrade is needed for
multiple interconnection customers’ generating facilities.
Several commenters request that the Commission provide more specificity and
guidance regarding the specific thresholds and metrics that transmission providers are
expected to submit on compliance.920 In this final rule, we modify the proposed
requirement in pro forma LGIP section 4.2.1 for transmission providers to revise their
LGIPs on compliance to include specific thresholds and metrics. Instead, we direct

transmission providers on compliance to provide tariff provisions that describe, for each
type of system network upgrade that a transmission provider would identify in the cluster
study process (e.g., voltage support network upgrades or short circuit network upgrades),
how the costs of each system network upgrade type will be allocated among the
interconnection customers within the cluster. Transmission providers’ revisions on
compliance must provide that costs for a discrete network upgrade identified in the
cluster study process (e.g., reconductoring a portion of a transmission line to
accommodate the interconnection of several generating facilities in the cluster) are
allocated to only the interconnection customers in the cluster that are shown through
technical analyses to contribute to the need for the discrete network upgrade. For
example, the transmission provider must propose tariff provisions similar to the
following: (1) voltage support related network upgrades shall be allocated using a
voltage impact analysis, which will identify each generating facility’s contribution to the
voltage violation; (2) short circuit network upgrade costs within a cluster will be
allocated based on the impact from each generating facility within the cluster, on the
constrained facilities under the most constraining fault in the relevant study case(s); or (3)
the estimated costs of short circuit related general reliability network upgrades identified
through a cluster study shall be assigned to all interconnection requests in that group
study pro rata on the basis of the short circuit duty contribution of each generating
facility.
PJM requests that the Commission clarify that transmission providers may provide
the detailed and specific technical information in business practice manuals rather than in

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

tariffs.921 In response, we find that, as noted above, transmission providers must provide
tariff provisions that describe the method they will use for allocating costs of each type of
network upgrade, but specific metrics and thresholds for implementing the allocation, or
other specific technical information, may be included in business practice manuals, or
publicly posted on the transmission provider’s website. We agree with PJM that such
details are appropriate for business practice manuals, consistent with Commission
precedent applying the “rule of reason” to determine whether a detail should be included
in a tariff or business practice manual. In particular, the technical information
surrounding implementation of the proportional impact method by a particular
transmission provider does not need to be included in the transmission provider’s tariff
under the rule of reason because these provisions are properly classified as
implementation details that do not significantly affect rates, terms, and conditions of
service.922
Several commenters request that the Commission direct transmission providers to
use a specific type of proportional impact method or distribution factor analysis and
apply minimum distribution factor thresholds that will be used to evaluate NRIS and
ERIS requests.923 We are unpersuaded that such level of prescription is needed to ensure

just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential rates. Instead, we believe
that flexibility for transmission providers to develop such details as part of their
compliance filings—and in their business practice manuals, where consistent with the
rule of reason, as discussed above—is important to ensure that the proportional impact
method used by each transmission provider reflects the characteristics of its region (e.g.,
types of network upgrade facilities identified in the region, or preferred analyses in the
region for determining the share of the need for the specific network upgrade type). For
the same reason, we decline to require transmission providers to use consistent, uniform
thresholds to measure impact, as requested by Pine Gate.924
Based on the record, we decline to require transmission providers to use the
proportional capacity method to allocate the costs of all system network upgrades, given
our decision to instead opt for the proportional impact method and because it reflects the
Commission’s interconnection pricing policy for facilities designated as network
upgrades needed for the interconnection of the cluster. Nonetheless, we recognize that
there may be a tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy when considering proportional
capacity versus proportional impact for cost allocation for network upgrades. While we
require transmission providers to allocate network upgrade costs based on a proportional
impact method based on the record in this final rule, we acknowledge that other

allocation methods could potentially meet the consistent with or superior to standard or
the independent entity variation standard if, among other things, they allocate network
upgrade costs in a manner consistent with the Commission’s interconnection pricing
policy.
We disagree with NV Energy and PacifiCorp’s arguments that the proportional
impact method carries unmanageable time, restudy, and reallocation risks.925 In response
to concerns about restudy risk resulting from withdrawals, we note that the Commission’s
new cluster study process requires transmission providers to complete the process within
150 calendar days, which we believe is sufficiently long for transmission providers to be
able to conduct the rounds of restudy and reallocation that are needed to achieve a stable
interconnection queue and reduce the risk of further withdrawals before moving to the
individual facilities studies. Further, the proportional impact method is currently used by
most transmission providers that conduct cluster studies, and several of these
transmission providers have adopted study timelines similar to what we adopt in this final
rule.926
We disagree with claims from NV Energy and PacifiCorp that the proportional
impact method must be conducted as if it were a serial study in that each interconnection

request must be studied individually. When proposing a proportional impact method on
compliance, transmission providers have many methods to choose from and should adopt
a method that allows them to meet the timelines designated in the cluster study process.
In response to PPL,927 we confirm that within the cluster study process, any network
upgrade costs previously allocated to a withdrawing interconnection customer that are
still required after the withdrawal may be reallocated among the remaining
interconnection customers in the cluster based on the relevant cost allocation method
applied to the network upgrade facility type.
Finally, several commenters suggest alternative reforms to the Commission’s
network upgrade cost allocation policies: (1) limit the use of cluster areas as an
alternative to the proposed cost allocation method within a cluster;928 (2) change the
interconnection pricing policy or participant funding regime (as allowed in certain
RTOs/ISOs) to limit participant funding and/or require assessment of whether
transmission customers benefit from and should pay for network upgrades;929 (3)
establish a process to eliminate the use of headroom on network transmission facilities;930

Shared Network Upgrades
a.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that the absence of network
upgrade cost sharing provisions in the pro forma LGIP may pose a barrier to entry to
generation development.932 The Commission stated that absent cost sharing provisions
among clusters, interconnection customers may significantly benefit from earlier-in-time
network upgrades but not share in the cost of those network upgrades in a manner that is
roughly commensurate with benefits. The Commission therefore proposed to require
transmission providers to allocate the costs of network upgrades between interconnection
customers in an earlier cluster and interconnection customers in a subsequent cluster that
benefit from the same network upgrade in a manner that is roughly commensurate with
the benefits received.933 Specifically, the Commission proposed that when the
transmission provider analyzes the network upgrades identified through its cluster study
process, if a generating facility of an interconnection customer in a later cluster directly
connects either to (1) a network upgrade in service for less than five years or (2) a

substation where the network upgrade in service for less than five years terminates, then
the transmission provider would be required to designate the network upgrade a shared
network upgrade. Upon such a designation, the interconnection customer in the later
cluster would be required to contribute a pro rata portion of the shared network upgrade’s
remaining undepreciated capital cost based on the impact the interconnection customer in
the later cluster has on the network upgrade, as measured using the same method the
transmission provider used to determine the impact of the interconnection customer(s) in
the earlier cluster.
The Commission proposed that if the new generating facility does not directly
connect to the network upgrade, then the transmission provider would perform a power
flow analysis with a two-step test to measure the lower-queued interconnection
customer’s use of and benefit from the network upgrade funded by interconnection
customers from an earlier cluster. Under the first step, the transmission provider would
determine if the impact of the interconnection customer in the later cluster exceeds
five MW and exceeds one percent of the network upgrade’s rating. Then, if those criteria
are met, the transmission provider would determine if the lower-queued interconnection
customer’s impact either exceeds more than 5% of the network upgrade’s facility rating
or if the transmission distribution factor is greater than 20%. Finally, if either of these
criteria were met, the transmission provider would be required to designate that network
upgrade a shared network upgrade, and the interconnection customer in the later cluster
would be responsible for a pro rata share of the network upgrade’s remaining
undepreciated capital cost based on the impact the interconnection customer in the later

cluster has on the network upgrade, as measured using the same method the transmission
provider used to determine the impact of the interconnection customer(s) from the earlier
cluster.
The Commission proposed to require the interconnection customer in the later
cluster to pay the transmission provider for the interconnection customer’s share of the
shared network upgrade costs through a one-time lump sum, which the transmission
provider would disburse to the appropriate interconnection customer(s) from the earlier
cluster.934 The Commission also proposed that, where applicable, the interconnection
customer from the earlier cluster or the relevant transmission provider would be required
to assign transmission credits for the portion of the shared network upgrade that the
interconnection customer in the later cluster funded to the interconnection customer in the
later cluster. Additionally, the Commission proposed to require that the interconnection
customer in the later cluster not be required to pay for its share of the cost of the shared
network upgrade until that shared network upgrade is in service. The Commission also
proposed to require transmission providers to provide the list of shared network upgrades
to interconnection customers in subsequent clusters at the conclusion of the cluster study
and to list those network upgrades in the appendix of the relevant interconnection
customer’s LGIA. The Commission acknowledged that there could be scenarios where
the network upgrade may be identified as both a shared network upgrade and a contingent
facility; and, thus a designation of a network upgrade as a contingent facility does not

Comments in Support

Multiple commenters support the proposal.936 OMS states that, while cost sharing
arrangements can be resource intensive and contentious, they can be crucial to facilitating
an equitable interconnection process.937 NARUC states that the proposal is a logical
extension of the cluster cost sharing concept and could spread costs over even more
interconnection customers benefitting from network upgrades.938 A couple of
commenters contend that the proposal will provide more certainty and result in fewer
withdrawals, thus reducing associated restudies and study processing delays.939
Several commenters believe that the proposal will address the issue of “first
movers/free riders” when interconnection customers in a later cluster study benefit from

claims that avoiding first mover subsidization of free riders is particularly important for
offshore wind interconnections because of the potential lack of onshore access points
and, therefore, argues that the Commission should be open to non-traditional cost
allocation methods when contemplating methods to mitigate first mover risk.941
Additionally, some commenters believe that the proposal is consistent with the
Commission’s cost causation policy.942 Avangrid asserts that, when surplus transmission
capacity created by a recent network upgrade is used by a later generating facility, the
lower-queued interconnection customer should share the costs in a way that is
commensurate with benefits like those allocated using the original proportional impact
method assessment.943

interconnection requests submitted but believes that it will reduce barriers to entry for all

Comments in Opposition

Some commenters oppose the proposal.945 Several commenters assert that it will
not yield many benefits and that the Commission should focus on other reforms that are
more likely to reduce network upgrade costs and improve the equity of allocating them
among beneficiaries.946 Dominion and Fervo Energy argue that interconnection
customers in subsequent clusters do not “cause” the costs to be incurred, and to the extent
the interconnection customers will benefit, they will contribute through their payment for
transmission service.947

power flow studies conducted up to five years after the in-service date of non-adjacent
network upgrades will inevitably fail to accurately divide the relevant interconnection
costs among disparate-in-time interconnection customers due to the many coinciding yet
unrelated system changes that will affect the outcomes of such analyses.952 PacifiCorp

additional time-consuming analysis, which would only worsen for transmission providers

customers within a cluster simultaneously learn their network upgrade costs and
associated cost responsibility, creating greater cost certainty.956
iii.

Alternatives and Requests for Flexibility

Several commenters recommend modifications to the proposal.957 A few
recommend that the Commission implement a minimum threshold before a network
upgrade would be evaluated as a potential shared network upgrade.958 MISO and Xcel
state that changes will be necessary in RTO/ISO regions where a transmission owner may
unilaterally provide upfront funding for network upgrades to integrate the cost allocation
for such a funding mechanism with the shared network upgrade proposal.959 ENGIE
recommends that the Commission set requirements in the interconnection process to
identify interconnection facilities and network upgrades that are necessary to interconnect
the generating facility, as well as network upgrades needed to mitigate local transmission
constraints, and asserts that interconnection customers should not be responsible for the

costs of distant and minimally impacted network upgrades.960 Xcel also contends that the
interconnection customer in the subsequent cluster should enter into a multiparty
facilities service agreement to reimburse the interconnection customers in the earlier
cluster, rather than pay the proposed lump sum payment to the transmission provider.961
Pattern Energy recommends that the interconnection customer in the later cluster be
required to repay the earlier interconnection customer at the time of execution of the
subsequent interconnection customer’s interconnection agreement, and not when the
relevant shared network upgrades go into service.962
A few commenters propose alternative methods for cost allocation for shared
network upgrades.963 For instance, Xcel argues that the Commission should be clear that
it will accept other proposals to determine if a network upgrade is shareable to
subsequent interconnection requests.964
Some commenters support regional flexibility for transmission providers to
implement any shared network upgrade mechanism.965 For example, NESCOE suggests

that allowing transmission providers, especially RTOs/ISOs, some flexibility in
coordinating with their states on developing proposed approaches to sharing the costs
associated with network upgrades funded by interconnection customers in earlier clusters
could minimize the contentious nature of developing cost sharing arrangements.966
Other commenters recommend that the Commission not adopt the shared network
upgrade proposal in non-RTO/ISO regions where interconnection customers provide
upfront funds for the network upgrades and receive reimbursement through transmission
credits from the transmission provider, plus interest (i.e., the interconnection pricing
policy established in Order No. 2003).967 Pine Gate states that under the NOPR proposal,
interconnection customers in later clusters would potentially reimburse interconnection
customers in earlier clusters sooner than the transmission provider would have via
transmission credits, but with the same result.968 Enel asserts that coupling shared
network upgrades with transmission credits creates even more administrative complexity,
as an interconnection customer in a later cluster providing funds to an interconnection
customer in an earlier cluster would necessitate a partial transfer of transmission credits,
potentially on a partially depreciated asset, which creates an extremely complex payment,

reimbursement, and multiparty crediting system that would be administratively
burdensome.969 Similarly, APS and Duke Southeast Utilities express concern over an
additional complication in the event the earlier interconnection customer has already been
fully reimbursed for the network upgrades through transmission credits.970 In contrast,
Vistra contends that the shared network upgrade proposal will be beneficial in regions
with transmission crediting as it will speed reimbursement relative to the status quo.971
Vistra claims that, when an overlap exists between the reimbursement of an
interconnection customer through transmission credits and the reimbursement mechanism
in this proposal, this proposal will appropriately charge interconnection customers in
subsequent clusters.
Other commenters raise additional cost allocation concerns with the shared
network upgrade proposal. Enel argues that, in markets where transmission credits do
not apply, reimbursement for funding network upgrades is often granted in the form of
congestion hedging mechanisms, and the repayment of network upgrade costs from a
lower-queued interconnection customer to a higher-queued interconnection customer
could create the need for a partial transfer of these congestion hedging rights.972 SDG&E

with cost responsibility terminates an executed LGIA but the network upgrades are still
needed for later interconnection customers, thus leaving the transmission provider as the
backstop for financing the network upgrade.973 A few commenters argue that the
Commission should limit its proposal to share network upgrade costs between clusters to
areas whether interconnection customers are not already reimbursed for network upgrade
costs.974
Several commenters note that some RTOs/ISOs have similar existing cost
allocation mechanisms to the NOPR proposal and request that, in those instances, the
Commission defer to those transmission providers when the existing mechanisms are
accomplishing the final rule’s objectives.975 On a similar note, PJM and Indicated PJM
TOs request that the Commission not require PJM to implement cost sharing between its
clusters.976

- 333 Commission Determination

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to revise the pro forma LGIP and pro
forma LGIA to implement shared network upgrades between interconnection customers
in an earlier cluster and interconnection customers in a subsequent cluster. We find that
the reforms adopted in this final rule that require transmission providers to allocate
network upgrade costs to interconnection customers within the same cluster using a
proportional impact method, as discussed above, will provide interconnection customers
with more cost certainty during the interconnection process and will allow for sharing of
network upgrade costs between interconnection customers that benefit from those
network upgrades within the same cluster.
The record demonstrates the complexity of the NOPR proposal and potentially
significant administrative burdens associated with implementing it for at least some
transmission providers, especially under the Commission’s interconnection pricing
policy. We agree with some commenters that adopting the proposal would not provide
cost certainty to interconnection customers in earlier clusters at the point that they have to
proceed in the interconnection process because they would lack certainty about potential
reimbursement for network upgrades from interconnection customers in subsequent
clusters.978 Thus, the NOPR proposal is unlikely to reduce barriers to generation

development due to the absence of network upgrade cost sharing provisions. Further, the
proposal may introduce burdens for lower-queued interconnection customers that could
be faced with reimbursing a higher-queued interconnection customer for a new shared
network upgrade cost late in the interconnection process. For these reasons, we decline
to adopt this NOPR proposal.979
We find that the final rule’s reforms to conduct cluster studies and to allocate the
costs of any assigned network upgrades to the cluster’s interconnection customers on a
proportional basis address the “first mover/free rider” issue.980 Under this final rule, a
transmission provider must study interconnection customers in an earlier cluster study
based on the transmission system at that time, and those interconnection customers will
be assigned network upgrades that would not be needed but for their interconnection to
the transmission system; then, the transmission provider will study interconnection
customers in a subsequent cluster study based on the transmission system at that point in
time, and those interconnection customers will be assigned any necessary network

upgrades that would not be needed but for their interconnection to the transmission
system. Further, we note that under the Commission’s interconnection pricing policy,
interconnection customers receive reimbursement for network upgrade costs, which helps
to mitigate any “first mover/free rider” concerns because interconnection customers are
reimbursed through transmission credits. In addition, we find that the aforementioned
reforms to conduct cluster studies and use a proportional impact method to allocate the
costs of network upgrades within a cluster will also address “first mover/free rider”
concerns in regions with independent entity variations to the interconnection pricing
policy.
Because we decline to adopt this proposal, we do not respond to the requests for
clarification or the requests for modifications to the NOPR proposal that would not
address the reasons provided above for declining to adopt the NOPR proposal as a
general matter.

Increased Financial Commitments and Readiness Requirements

In the NOPR, the Commission stated that the pro forma LGIP allows an
interconnection customer to proceed through the generator interconnection process
without having shown evidence to the transmission provider of meaningful progress
toward achieving commercial viability.981 The Commission stated its concern that,
without requiring this type of evidence, interconnection customers will continue to
submit multiple speculative interconnection requests and later withdraw those requests,

triggering rounds of restudies. The Commission therefore proposed a set of reforms to
adopt more stringent financial commitments and readiness requirements for
interconnection customers to remain in the interconnection queue to discourage
speculative interconnection requests and allow transmission providers to focus on
processing viable interconnection requests and to better approximate the cost of the
interconnection study process.982
a.

Increased Study Deposits
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to adopt the following study deposit
framework in the pro forma LGIP:983
Size of Proposed Generating
Facility Associated with
Interconnection Request
> 20 MW < 80 MW
> 80 MW < 200 MW
> 200 MW

Amount of Deposit
$35,000 + $1,000/MW
$150,000
$250,000

The Commission proposed to require transmission providers to collect this study
deposit before each phase of the new first-ready, first-served cluster study process (i.e.,
cluster study, cluster restudy, and facilities study).984 The Commission proposed to
require the interconnection customer to provide: (1) an initial study deposit along with its

interconnection request, which will be used to pay for the cluster study; (2) the second
study deposit of the same amount within 20 days of receiving the cluster study report
from the transmission provider to cover the cost of any clustered restudies; and (3) the
third study deposit of the same amount along with its executed facilities study agreement.
The Commission explained that study deposits would be refundable, and that the
transmission provider would refund any portion of the study deposits above the
applicable study costs and withdrawal penalties once the interconnection customer
executes the LGIA, requests the filing of an unexecuted LGIA and submits the
corresponding payment discussed below, or withdraws from the interconnection queue.
The Commission also proposed to delete section 8.1.1 of the pro forma LGIP to remove
the requirement for transmission providers to invoice interconnection customers on a
monthly basis for the work conducted on the facilities study.
The Commission sought comment on whether: (1) the proposed study deposit
amounts accurately estimate the cost of conducting cluster studies; and (2) to adopt
additional provisions or a different framework that would require larger proposed
generating facilities to provide a higher deposit amount—such as a per MW
framework.985

Associations do not oppose the heightened study deposit requirements, provided that they
are paired with real predictability on the timing of studies and real certainty on the costs
of network upgrades.989 CAISO argues that the Commission must raise study deposits
significantly, and contends that it is illusory to argue that interconnection customers
without significant capital can progress to commercial operation in today’s hypercompetitive climate.990 PPL asserts that the Commission’s proposed study deposits are
likely on the low end of what is required to ensure proper “skin in the game,” but should
work for many regions, including New England.991 Tri-State overall supports the
proposed study deposit amounts but notes that interconnection customers proposing
smaller generating facilities will end up paying a lower study deposit than what Tri-State
is currently charging.992 ENGIE, MISO, and SPP would prefer to collect study deposits

APS suggests that any refundable deposits should not include the Commission
interest rate and argues that, by requiring additional funds to be deposited as described in
the NOPR, the Commission’s proposal would lead to an exorbitant increase in the
amount of Commission interest paid back to an interconnection customer as it moves
along through the process at the transmission provider’s expense.998
Other commenters mostly oppose the NOPR proposal to increase study
deposits.999 CREA and NewSun agree that a tiered study deposit level tied to
interconnection capacity requested may be warranted and at most study deposits should
be increased to more accurately cover the cost of the studies, but comment that the rest of
the NOPR’s proposal appears to increase the study deposit levels solely to deter
interconnection customers from entering the interconnection queue, not because the
current level of study deposits is insufficient to cover the costs of the studies.1000 CREA
and NewSun argue that, if this rulemaking generates evidence that the current study
deposit levels are insufficient to cover the typical costs of studies, an increase may be
justified, but until then, study deposits should not be increased. Eversource recommends
that the Commission consider making the rate of increase per MW more gradual, and that
based on the current proposed figures, the deposits may increase too quickly relative to

discriminatory or punitive to pumped storage as compared to other renewable
technologies because a large capacity pumped storage facility would expect to hit the
maximum deposit and/or penalty in every stage of the interconnection study process,
LGIA, and potential withdrawal.1002 RWE Renewables fully supports allocating some
risk for each generating facility entered into the interconnection queue to interconnection
customers, but argues that increased financial deposits have unfortunately not been an
adequate deterrent to a high volume of non-viable generating facilities entering into the
interconnection queues.1003
In response to the Commission’s request for comment on whether the proposed
study deposit amounts accurately estimate the cost of conducting cluster studies, Ameren
states that, based on its experience, the proposed study deposits are in line with the cost
of conducting the cluster studies.1004 Xcel contends that the proposed study deposits are
more than the cost of studies in its experience, but as studies will need to be accelerated
under the Commission’s proposal (to meet timelines) and may involve more actions, the
proposed study cost may be appropriate.1005 NV Energy states that, on average, it spends

studies and refunds the remaining deposits with interest.1006 Cypress Creek comments
that in its experience, study costs can vary widely depending on the transmission
provider, the staff resources it has available to conduct the study, and whether it needs to
contract with external resources to conduct the study.1007
CREA and NewSun urge the Commission to maintain a lower study deposit prior
to obtaining the initial cluster study. They argue that larger study deposits are only
justified once the interconnection customer can realistically assess the commercial
viability of its proposed generating facility within the cluster after obtaining the potential
interconnection costs.1008 Fervo Energy contends that more information is needed before
one can conclude that the proposed study deposit amount framework would not result in
deposits that far exceed the actual cost of the studies, particularly in light of the
withdrawal penalty proposal.1009 Cypress Creek suggests that the Commission should
provide additional justification and argues that the NOPR fails to provide any further
justification for study costs (i.e., based on a market analysis or other method), stating

only that the proposed amounts “better approximate the cost of the interconnection study
process.” 1010
In response to the Commission’s request for comment on whether the Commission
should adopt additional provisions or a different framework that would require larger
proposed generating facilities to provide a higher study deposit amount, such as a per
MW framework, PJM contends that the Commission should adopt readiness payments or
study deposits based on the costs of the network upgrades necessary to interconnect the
generating facilities in the cluster, which also contain “at-risk” non-refundable
provisions.1011

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal to require interconnection
customers to pay, and transmission providers to collect, study deposits as part of the
cluster study process.1012 Specifically, we adopt the NOPR proposal to require the
following study deposit framework in section 3.1.1.1 of the pro forma LGIP:

Here, we refer to initial study deposits separately from the LGIA deposit. We
discuss the latter in Section III.A.6.d below. In the NOPR, the Commission discussed the
deposits together, NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 109, although the proposed pro forma
LGIP treated the initial study deposit, proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.1.1.1 (Initial
Study Deposit), separate from the LGIA deposit, proposed pro forma LGIP section
3.1.1.3 (LGIA Deposit).

However, we modify the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
collect a single study deposit only once upon entry into the cluster (initial study deposit),
rather than requiring transmission providers to collect a study deposit at each phase of the
cluster study process, as proposed in the NOPR. Therefore, we decline to adopt the
proposed revisions to sections 3.1.1.2, 7.5, and 8.1 of the pro forma LGIP that would
have implemented the phased study deposit approach. As a result of this modification to
the NOPR proposal, the initial study deposit will be required only at the time the
interconnection customer submits an interconnection request. The amount of the initial
study deposit will be calculated using the tiered approach proposed in the NOPR based
on the proposed MW size of the generating facility, as shown in the chart above.
We adopt the tiered approach based on the proposed MW size of the generating
facility for determining the amount of the initial study deposit because larger proposed
generating facilities within a cluster generally cost more to study than smaller proposed
generating facilities within a cluster. Further, although we acknowledge that this
approach does not perfectly approximate study costs, we find it appropriate to require the
transmission provider to collect a study deposit based on a tiered approach because study
costs will be trued up and any excess deposit refunded once the interconnection customer

executes the LGIA or requests the filing of an unexecuted LGIA and submits the
corresponding payment discussed below or withdraws from the interconnection queue.
We modify the NOPR proposal to require only a single initial study deposit, rather
than multiple deposits at different stages of the cluster study process, as proposed in the
NOPR. We believe that this modification will appropriately reduce the administrative
burden for transmission providers to collect and manage the deposits.1013 We recognize
that the amount of the study deposit for interconnection customers will be lower than that
proposed in the NOPR because of this modification. We are persuaded by commenters’
arguments that initial study deposits are best used to provide transmission providers with
funds to cover the costs of studies performed for interconnection customers rather than to
serve as a disincentive against speculative interconnection requests.1014 We therefore
adopt an initial study deposit framework that better reflects the costs of the
interconnection studies. For example, NV Energy states that, on average, it spends
between $80,000 and $100,000 between the cluster system impact study and facilities
studies and refunds the remaining deposits with interest.1015 Under the study deposit
framework we adopt, study deposits range between $55,000 and $250,000 for the
smallest and largest proposed generating facilities, respectively, and thus reasonably track

likely study costs based on the record. We believe that other reforms adopted in this final
rule—notably, the commercial readiness deposits and the site control requirements—will
adequately serve as a disincentive against speculative interconnection requests without
unnecessarily duplicating those efforts through increased study deposits.
Additionally, we adopt the NOPR proposal to delete section 8.1.1 of the pro forma
LGIP to remove the requirement for transmission providers to invoice interconnection
customers on a monthly basis for the work conducted on the facilities study. We find that
this monthly invoicing requirement is burdensome to the transmission provider and
unnecessary given that section 13.3 of the pro forma LGIP includes policies for invoicing
and establishes that interconnection customers are responsible for the actual costs of
interconnection studies. Accordingly, we also delete from pro forma LGIP Appendix 3
(Interconnection Facilities Study Agreement), the portion of article 5.0 that includes the
monthly invoicing requirement.
We disagree with rPlus’ argument that study deposit requirements are unduly
discriminatory or punitive to pumped storage because of its large capacity.1016 We note
that the initial study deposit reforms we adopt in this final rule are agnostic to the type of
generating facility. Rather, the initial study deposits are based on the MW size of the
proposed generating facility, regardless of the type of generating facility, such that
interconnection customers proposing larger generating facilities will pay a larger deposit.
As explained above, this reflects the fact that the expected costs to study those generating

facilities are generally higher. Nonetheless, the modification we adopt here has the effect
of lowering the required study deposit for all interconnection customers relative to the
NOPR proposal, a finding which may partially allay rPlus’ concern.
b.

Demonstration of Site Control
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it believed that more stringent site
control requirements will help prevent interconnection customers from submitting
interconnection requests for speculative, commercially non-viable proposed generating
facilities.1017 The Commission preliminarily found that an interconnection customer
securing the exclusive land right necessary to construct its proposed generating facility
(or for co-located resources, demonstration of shared land use) is sufficient evidence of
the interconnection customer’s commitment to construct the generating facility.
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to require
interconnection customers to demonstrate 100% site control for their proposed generating
facilities when they submit their interconnection request.1018 The Commission proposed

1017

NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 115.

1018

Id. P 116. The Commission proposed the following definition of ‘site control’
in the NOPR:
“Site Control shall mean the exclusive land right to develop, construct,
operate, and maintain the Generating Facility over the term of expected
operation of the Generating Facility. Site Control may be demonstrated by
documentation establishing: (1) ownership of, a leasehold interest in, or a
right to develop a site of sufficient size to construct and operate the
Generating Facility or multiple Generating Facilities on a shared site behind
one Point of Interconnection; (2) an option to purchase or acquire a leasehold

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 349 -

to have transmission providers include in their tariff specific acreage requirements for
each generating facility technology type to demonstrate site control.
To cut down on multiple interconnection customers leasing the same site in order
to remain in the interconnection queue, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma
LGIP to require interconnection customers to demonstrate the exclusive land right (where
the land rights are exclusive to the interconnection customer, not necessarily the
individual generating facility) to develop, construct, operate, and maintain its generating
facility or, where facilities are co-located, to demonstrate a shared land use right to
develop, construct, operate, and maintain co-located facilities.1019
Additionally, the Commission proposed to include a limited option for
interconnection customers to submit a deposit in lieu of site control when they submit
their interconnection request only when regulatory limitations prohibit the interconnection
customer from obtaining site control.1020 The Commission explained that in such
instances, the interconnection customer would submit an initial deposit in lieu of site
control of $10,000 per MW, subject to a floor of $500,000 and a ceiling

of $2 million,

site for such purpose; (3) site of sufficient size to construct and operate the
Generating Facility; or (4) any other documentation that clearly demonstrates
the right of Interconnection Customer to exclusively occupy a site of
sufficient size to construct and operate the Generating Facility. Site Control
for any Co-Located Resource is demonstrated by a contract or other
agreement demonstrating shared land use for all Co-Located Resources that
meet the aforementioned provisions of this Site Control definition.”

which would be applied toward any interconnection studies or a withdrawal penalty, if
applicable. The Commission specified that such an interconnection customer must
demonstrate 100% site control prior to the facilities study. The Commission further
proposed that, after the interconnection customer notifies the transmission provider of a
change to its site control demonstration, the transmission provider must give the
interconnection customer 10 business days to demonstrate that the site control
demonstration meets the applicable requirement after notification.1021
The Commission sought comment on: (1) whether there are other specific
situations in which the Commission should accept a deposit in lieu of site control;
(2) whether the definition of site control, including the requirement to obtain an exclusive
land right (or, for co-located resources, a shared land right), should be broadened or
refined to account for circumstances that may arise in, for example, the siting and
permitting of offshore resources in bodies of water and/or submerged land; (3) whether
and how the definition of site control should be adjusted for interconnection customers to
account for any regulatory requirements they may have associated with proposed
generating facilities developed on sites owned or physically controlled by a state
government entity and/or a federal government entity; (4) the appropriate stage in
developing such sites when the Commission should view completion of such stage as
indicative of an interconnection customer’s request being non-speculative and whether
there are substantive differences among interconnection customers developing sites

owned or physically controlled by a state government entity and/or a federal government
entity; (5) whether the Commission should allow transmission providers to accept
demonstrations of less than 100% site control in the initial phases of the interconnection
study process, outside of when regulatory limitations prohibit the interconnection
customer from obtaining site control; and (6) whether the Commission should instead
adopt site control provisions that allow a deposit in lieu of site control to enter the
generator interconnection process and be evaluated under the first-ready, first-served
cluster study process described above but require interconnection customers to
demonstrate site control to enter the facilities study.1022

that these measures can reduce speculative interconnection requests, represent a

Definition and Reasonable Evidence of
Site Control

Some commenters support the proposed definition of site control.1028 MISO notes
that the proposed requirement for exclusivity or the demonstration of a right to co-locate
generating facilities is in MISO’s current tariff and that these requirements have proven
to be successful at preventing speculative interconnection requests from entering or
continuing in the interconnection queue.1029
Some commenters suggest modifications to the definition of site control. ENGIE
and Tri-State recommend that the Commission consider requirements similar to MISO’s
requirements to identify when and whether an interconnection request is nonspeculative.1030 Xcel supports modifying the definition of site control to ensure
exclusivity and allow for co-ownership.1031

interconnection requests, unless the site is large enough to host multiple generating
facilities.1032
Enel supports the proposal to require land rights that are exclusive to one
development company, but not necessarily to the individual generating facility.1033
According to Enel, when used regarding land rights, “exclusive” means that only the
owner of those land rights can possess the property, and this interpretation could prevent
co-located resources from being built if one parent company was using two separate
special purpose vehicles for two different generating facilities sharing land. Enel
therefore recommends that the Commission clarify the intent of this word so that it does
not artificially restrict multi-use applications.
Cypress Creek believes that, to the extent the Commission intends that a “land
right” should involve zoning approval, such a proposal would be unreasonable because
interconnection customers do not typically initiate local permitting until the system
impact study phase, due to the system impact study’s impact to overall generating facility
commercial viability.1034
Southern requests that the Commission clarify subpart (3) of the proposed site
control definition, arguing that, as written, it appears to be an incomplete statement that
may authorize an interconnection customer to simply provide evidence that a site is big

enough to host a proposed generating facility rather than evidence that the
interconnection customer actually has any rights to that property.1035 Enel argues that
subpart (3) to the definition should be deleted, because as modified, that item is
duplicative of and a subset of the materials covered under subpart (1).1036
Other parties request that the Commission clarify the definition of site control to
specify what constitutes reasonable evidence to demonstrate 100% site control1037 or

NYISO requests that the final rule establish uniform requirements across regions for
making the 100% site control determination.1039 APS requests that the Commission
specify what is considered reasonable evidence in the same manner that the Commission
defines commercial readiness milestones and argues that clarification is needed in order
to avoid subjectivity regarding what is considered “reasonable” evidence to the
transmission provider.1040

Omaha Public Power requests that the Commission clarify whether transmission
providers will be able to accept lease options, instead of executed leases, as sufficient
evidence of site control.1041 Omaha Public Power notes that it has become industry
standard to use lease options and argues that the Commission should not enact a rule that
conflicts with current industry standard practices. SoCal Edison supports the NOPR
proposal, provided that 100% site control includes an option to lease up to, and including,
the commercial operation date or acquire the land when the interconnection request is
submitted.1042
EPSA advises the Commission to consider options to demonstrate site control,
including requiring attestations that a lessee or potential owner is in exclusive
negotiations to establish site control, though it generally supports the development of
clearer demonstrations.1043 Interwest Energy Alliance recommends that the Commission
consider evidence of active negotiations as potentially a sufficient demonstration of site
control before the closing of the cluster request window.1044

the interconnection request.1045 SoCal Edison explains that it has run into challenges
when trying to determine whether interconnection customers have exclusive site control,
in part due to the fact that companies change over time with renaming and/or mergers.
NRECA suggests that demonstration of site control with exclusive land rights
should be allowed to include provisions that such rights are contingent upon favorable
interconnection study results, inclusive of cost and schedule.1046 NRECA notes that site
control land options on many occasions come with a caveat that the lessee or purchaser
has the ability to terminate within a due diligence period if interconnection results are
unfavorable due to cost or schedule.1047
NV Energy requests clarification on whether an interconnection request should be
deemed withdrawn if the interconnection customer does not provide demonstration of site
control by the execution of the facilities study agreement.1048
Ørsted urges the Commission to clarify that, for offshore wind projects, the
definition of “exclusive site control of the entire generating facility” means exclusive
control of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued offshore wind lease
area, not cable routes on state submerged land or onshore cable routes to the point of

other land use rights for portions of the offshore wind project on state submerged land or
for the offshore and onshore cable routes during the interconnection process.
NYTOs and Pacific Northwest Utilities argue that it is unclear what would
constitute 100% site control and therefore regions should be allowed to implement
appropriate definitions for their regions on compliance to address their specific
circumstances.1050
ISO-NE states that its existing LGIP and SGIP provisions, which are consistent
with those proposed in the NOPR, have proven to be effective, and that the Commission
should extend flexibility so that they may be maintained.1051 Similarly, Indicated PJM
TOs argue that the final rule should permit PJM to implement its 2022 interconnection
queue reform proposal for demonstrating site control, which is more rigorous than the
NOPR proposal.1052

Several parties support the NOPR proposal to define 100% site control as an
acreage requirement specific to the generating facility type and to require these acreage
requirements in the tariff.1053 Enel states that inclusion of acreage requirements in the
tariff gives the Commission visibility into regional requirements to ensure that no
transmission provider is significantly out of line with national assumptions.1054
Several commenters request that the Commission create a process by which an
interconnection customer can demonstrate that its generating facility requires a different
amount of acreage than the default value listed in the tariff.1055 AES predicts that this
approach will help ensure viable generating facilities are not inadvertently removed from
the interconnection queue.1056 MISO states that its tariff also allows an interconnection
customer to demonstrate that it can operate the proposed generating facility with fewer
acres.1057 National Grid believes that regional flexibility would certainly be required for
each transmission provider’s proposed acreage requirements and requests clarification

accordingly.1058 Some commenters suggest that transmission providers be required to
update the acreage requirements periodically to reflect technological advancements.1059
Other parties oppose the NOPR proposal to require specific acreage requirements
in the tariff1060 or suggest that these requirements should be included in business practice
manuals rather than tariffs.1061 Some commenters argue that these acreage requirements
will likely change with technology advances, and it would be burdensome if transmission
providers are required to submit an FPA section 205 filing every time they need to
change acreage requirements.1062 Fervo Energy argues that the risk in this proposal is
that the acreage requirements may understate the energy density of a generating facility
and thus overstate the number of acres required for a given number of MW, resulting in
discriminatory treatment between competing generation technologies.1063
Ørsted recommends that transmission providers use the most recent estimates of
power density from BOEM when establishing acreage requirements for offshore wind

projects.1064 Ørsted notes that offshore wind turbines have grown much larger in recent
years, which allows significantly more power production from the same amount of
acreage, and they argue that if transmission providers’ tariffs were not updated frequently
enough, the acreage requirements may become unreasonable.
Pine Gate recommends that acreage requirements specifically address how the
requirements will be applied to hybrid and co-located generating facilities.1065
Some commenters request that the Commission clarify whether the site control
requirement is limited to the generating facility or whether it also applies to transmission
system elements like interconnection facilities or other upgrades that may be identified
through the interconnection study process.1066 Several parties argue that, for the initial
request and study phase, 100% site control should not apply to land required to finalize
routes for generator ties lines.1067 AES argues that interconnection customers require
flexibility when siting generator tie lines, which usually occurs near the very end of the
interconnection process.1068 Enel notes that there are sometimes crossings of railroads,

outside the interconnection customer’s control.1069 AEE explains that issues can occur
when interconnection customers have all but one small parcel on the route of their
generating facility secured, with only one small piece of connectivity missing due to
permitting delays or other issues.1070 Similarly, Invenergy argues that it is unreasonable
and impractical to predict and obtain rights to land for facilities that have not yet been
identified.1071 Invenergy also states that the point of interconnection can change during
the study process, thus changing the land needs for the interconnection customer’s
interconnection facilities, and this change may be driven by a number of different factors,
including the transmission provider’s preference, which may be outside the
interconnection customer’s control.
Ørsted, ACE-NY, and Equinor Wind note a myriad of challenges for obtaining site
control for interconnection facilities for offshore wind projects, such as conflicts between

Ørsted argues that site control for interconnection facilities for offshore wind developers
is only obtainable very late in the interconnection process.1073
Other commenters argue that the Commission should expand the proposed
definition of site control to apply some degree of site control requirements to
interconnection facilities, such as a requirement to demonstrate 50% site control for
interconnection facilities when submitting the interconnection request.1074 MISO
encourages the Commission to require site control for interconnection facilities at the
same time that it requires site control for the generating facilities.1075 AEP explains that
some interconnection customers submit interconnection requests that are not feasible
given where interconnection customer interconnection facilities would have to be sited to
connect the generating facility to the transmission system at the selected point of
interconnection.1076 Additionally, AEP explains that, even if a generation site is suitable,
there may not be “room” at certain locations for a substation or switchyard due to a
variety of issues, including abandoned mines, surrounding wetlands, or other geographic
impediments.1077 According to AEP, site control for generating facilities can be far less

important than feasible control over the land needed to connect the generating facility to
the transmission system.
Enel argues that the addition of a generator tie line site control requirement will
increase the quality of interconnection study results and increase certainty for
interconnection customers as the interconnection process becomes more costly and risky
to navigate.1078 Enel states that it has observed or heard of interconnection customers
submitting existing site control from very remote locations to secure interconnection
queue positions, and later submitting a modification request to move the generating
facility site close to the point of interconnection after the generating facility’s actual
intended site control has been obtained. Enel states that this is done by interconnection
customers to reduce the duration and subsequently the cost of maintaining site control, as
a failed distant asset can be used for a new interconnection queue position elsewhere until
site control for the new generating facility area is complete. In addition, Enel states that
it supports SPP’s approach, which also requires 75% of generator tie line site control
after the first cluster restudy, to ensure interconnection customers are making reasonable
progress.
National Grid argues that demonstrating site control for interconnection facilities
is crucial for generating facility development and interconnection queue management
particularly in cases where numerous interconnection requests in the interconnection

argues that the payment of cash or the provision of other security in lieu of demonstration
of site control of transmission owner interconnection facilities or network upgrades built
by an interconnection customer does not further the goals of the NOPR.

Site Control Demonstration

Several commenters support the NOPR proposal to require interconnection
customers to demonstrate 100% site control for their proposed generating facilities when
they submit their interconnection request.1080 MISO argues that obtaining site control is
consistent with the “first-ready, first-served” model and that delaying site control for
interconnection requests until later in the interconnection process just increases the
instances of late-stage withdrawals that leads to uncertainty, unplanned restudies, and
delays for the remaining interconnection requests.1081 National Grid asserts that the
demonstration of complete and exclusive site control is necessary at the interconnection
request stage to avoid submission of interconnection requests prematurely, potential
conflicts with other interconnection requests, and delays in issuing cluster studies.1082

PJM opposes any requirement on transmission providers to accept demonstrations
of less than 100% site control at the time of an interconnection request, except for
accommodations for interconnection requests for proposed generating facilities to be
sited offshore or on government owned land.1084
MISO notes that its tariff requires redemonstrations of site control.1085 Similarly,
Indicated PJM TOs support requiring 100% site control at more than one decision

On the other hand, APS believes that simultaneous submission of the

and commercial readiness.1093 CESA and Clean Energy Associations argue that the
requirement for 100% site control at the interconnection request stage is excessively
stringent and would significantly favor utility-owned projects.1094
CREA and NewSun argue that the NOPR proposal is not adequately supported
and urge the Commission to maintain the existing site control requirements.1095 CREA
and NewSun argue that the proposal is unreasonable and “creates a Catch-22”:
specifically, that without reliable visibility as to the interconnection costs and viability for
its proposed generating facility within the specific cluster, the interconnection customer
will not be able to attract investment needed to secure site control. CREA and NewSun
also argue that a landowner hoping to see property developed may not agree to
permanently tie up land in a lease before the interconnection customer can show
interconnection is viable. CREA and NewSun argue that interconnection requests may
prove uneconomic after receipt of initial interconnection studies and thereafter cannot
finalize site control due to uneconomic interconnection costs. CREA and NewSun also
assert that the Commission made no effort in the NOPR to ascertain the impact on the
market of the “draconian” site control rules for such transmission providers that have
been allowed to adopt them.

R Street argues that requiring even partial site control at the time of the

because it would require more options contracts to be in place with landowners.1096
NextEra argues that site control is a limited indicator of generating facility viability.1097

control at the post-cluster study decision point and 100% site control at the post-facilities
study decision point.1101
AEE argues that 90% site control at the time of the interconnection request
provides interconnection customers sufficient flexibility.1102 Additionally, several
commenters state that 100% site control at the post-facilities study decision point would
be appropriate.1103 AEE argues that these altered requirements will reduce speculative
interconnection requests while also providing incentive for interconnection customers to
pursue remaining land rights after entering the interconnection queue.1104
Some commenters note that less than 100% site control at the interconnection

interconnection studies or other regulatory processes, which may lead to changes in the
size or design of a generating facility.1105 Additionally, SEIA requests that the

interconnection studies or regulatory changes.1106 Pine Gate notes that sometimes
interconnection customers are still actively negotiating with landowners close to the
deadline for a cluster review window and requests the Commission to permit
interconnection customers to demonstrate to the transmission prover that they are in
active negotiations to meet the heightened site control requirements.1107
Some commenters highlight that the NOPR proposal may be problematic or
challenging for interconnection customers of certain technology types or other
circumstances where obtaining site control is difficult. Hydropower Commenters argue
that most new hydropower facilities are sited at existing non-powered dams and therefore
hydropower interconnection customers face unique challenges when it comes to
obtaining site control.1108 The Ohio Commission Consumer Advocate asserts that the
proposal may be problematic for interconnection customers in Ohio because a recent
Ohio law permits Ohio counties to designate unincorporated areas in a county as an area
in which the development of a renewable energy project is prohibited.1109

According to Enel, some states limit the duration of site control.1110 Enel asserts
that, if site control is near to expiring for any reason, whether due to state restriction or
simply because the interconnection customer did not anticipate the length of
interconnection or permitting processes, landowners can demand higher payments than
agreed to in the original site control contract. Enel states that this can change the
economics of a proposed generating facility and even make a proposed generating facility
unprofitable, potentially leading to a late-stage interconnection request withdrawal.
Several commenters argue that the Commission should reject proposals to weaken
the site control requirements proposed in the NOPR.1111 APPA-LPPC argue that EPSA’s
and SEIA’s generalized complaints do not identify a specific obstacle created by the
Commission’s proposal, and APPA-LPPC argue that SEIA’s proposal to scale back the
site control requirement to not more than 75% was considered and rejected by MISO’s
management and stakeholders over concerns that it may not be rigorous enough to
mitigate the entry of speculative interconnection requests in the queue.1112

Several commenters support the NOPR proposal to eliminate the option for
interconnection customers to submit a deposit in lieu of site control except in limited
circumstances for regulatory limitations.1113 These commenters express that allowing
deposits in lieu of site control is not sufficient to demonstrate readiness or deter
speculative interconnection requests.1114 PJM notes that, in its experience, the option to
provide money in lieu of actual site control is easily abused by interconnection customers
with speculative interconnection requests.1115 CAISO notes that its most recent cluster
study was inundated by interconnection requests without site control because even a
$250,000 deposit in lieu of site control has not proven to be a deterrent for
interconnection customers.1116

Some commenters oppose the NOPR proposal and argue that the option to make

just those that demonstrate regulatory limitations.1117 Avangrid believes that an at-risk
deposit in lieu of site control that is set at a reasonable magnitude may be a good
alternative to ensure that an interconnection customer is rigorously pursuing completion
of a proposed generating facility.1118 Pacific Northwest Utilities suggest that the

facilities on land owned or managed by state, federal, or Tribal government entities
should be required to provide evidence that they submitted any required applications to
the relevant government entity or entities in order to advance the development of their
proposed generating facility. Pattern Energy states that such an interconnection request
should provide for an exclusive right to advance the development of a generating facility,
provided that the relevant government entity or entities allow for such an exclusive
right.1125
PJM notes that the proposed site control requirements that PJM included in its
interconnection queue reform filing with the Commission provide some leeway for
generating facilities constructed on federal or state lands or water, such as offshore wind
projects.1126 Alternatively, Dominion requests that the Commission clarify that the
deposit in lieu of site control exception would apply to offshore wind projects, in addition
to other proposed generating facilities subject to similar government control that may
prevent timely demonstration of site control.1127
Several commenters note that certain interconnection customers with generating
facilities and interconnection facilities on land controlled by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) face extended time frames for obtaining firm site control.1128 For

example, NV Energy states that the BLM permitting process can take between 18 months
and 5 years.1129 Idaho Power states that BLM goes through various stages of review, but
there is no specific stage that is indicative of an interconnection customer’s request
having firm site control until the permit is in hand, which can take up to three years to
obtain.1130 Idaho Power states that, currently, interconnection customers with generating
facilities on BLM lands typically reference the section of the site control definition that
allows for “an exclusivity or other business relationship between interconnection
customer and the entity having the right to sell, lease or grant interconnection customer
the right to possess or occupy a site for such purpose.”1131 Idaho Power argues that
generating facilities on land managed by BLM should have the same site control
requirements as all other generating facilities, but that they would support an expanded
and/or clarified definition of site control to capture the limitations of these generating
facilities. Idaho Power states that, for example, site control evidence may include
evidence that the necessary application has been received by the agency, is in process,
and the agency has indicated the generating facility is permittable.
NV Energy proposes that the deposit in lieu of site control be used for lands that
are federally managed, and that those deposits be held until the decision record, record of

decision, notice to proceed, or right-of-way grant is issued for a generating facility, which
NV Energy notes may not be until after the facilities study due to timing of the BLM
process.1132 To ensure the generating facility is progressing in the BLM process, NV
Energy also proposes that the interconnection customer be required to submit with its
interconnection request a schedule of the land rights and permitting as well as
documentation from BLM that the draft environmental assessment or draft environmental
impact statement is expected to be completed by issuance of the system impact study.
NV Energy also proposes that interconnection customers be required to provide the
administrative draft environmental assessment or draft environmental impact statement to
the transmission provider for review and comment once BLM has issued it to ensure its
interconnection facilities are included in the right-of-way that BLM will issue.
CREA and NewSun encourage the Commission to modify its proposed site control
requirements, such that an interconnection customer developing generating facilities on
public lands is allowed to proceed with the interconnection process if it can demonstrate
that the relevant public agency has received and has agreed to process the necessary
permits to develop the interconnection customer’s proposed generating facility.1133

demonstration of site control.1134 Additionally, Hydropower Commenters note that
generating facilities under a certain size can obtain an exemption from Commission
licensing requirements, and they argue that an exemption from licensing should also be
considered a sufficient demonstration of site control. Similarly, Hydropower
Commenters argue that developers of pumped storage projects on U.S. Forest Service or
BLM lands should not be required to complete the required Federal Land Policy and
Management Act process before they can be considered to have demonstrated sufficient
evidence of site control.1135 Hydropower Commenters contend that such generating
facilities should be allowed to demonstrate site control by submitting evidence that they
have a permit application pending with U.S. Forest Service or BLM.
Some commenters argue that the 100% site control requirement should not apply
to generating facilities being developed on Tribal lands.1136 OSPA claims that
development on Tribal land is more challenging than other kinds of development because
Tribes have three different classes of land that have different ownership structures and
regulatory restrictions, including “Trust” land, which is held by the federal government
on behalf of Tribes and regulated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.1137 OSPA notes that
Tribes’ Reservations are often “checker-boarded” with the three different classes of land,

and that large wind generating facilities will necessarily be sited on all three classes of
land. OSPA argues that securing Bureau of Indian Affairs regulatory approvals can take
years and that the ownership structure of “Allotted” lands can make it even difficult to
expediently obtain consent from all owners to lease certain tracts, which is required as
part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs process.1138
OSPA proposes that, for Tribes and Tribal Energy Development Organizations,
the Commission clarify that interconnection queue positions may be secured if the Tribe
has signed a lease, even if the Bureau of Indian Affairs has not issued a final approval.1139
Similarly, rPlus recommends that the filing of a valid preliminary permit application with
the Commission satisfy the site control requirement for a pumped storage project and for
generating facilities on Tribal lands.1140 rPlus notes that suitable pumped storage sites are
limited in availability and are increasingly located on public or Tribal lands, which
involve significant environmental review. rPlus notes that pumped storage projects
located on federal and Tribal lands generally cannot achieve full site control until federal
environmental reviews are complete and the Commission issues a license. For
circumstances where a pumped storage project does not require a Commission license,

rPlus requests that the site control requirement be only 50% of the land needed for the
core generating facility.1141
Several commenters state that the proposed site control requirements may present
challenges for offshore wind projects, which face extensive permitting timelines.1142
Clean Energy Associations argue that the formal issuance of a public lease often requires
multiple preliminary stages and major financial commitments from interconnection
customers and that requiring a lease prior to entering the interconnection queue would
unduly delay generating facilities on public lands.1143 Ørsted and Clean Energy
Associations further explain that the permitting process for an offshore wind farm often
involves multiple federal and state agencies and runs concurrently with the
interconnection process. Ørsted and Clean Energy Associations note that the permitting
process can lead to changes in the generating facility layout within a lease area, routing of
offshore cables, siting of onshore cable landing, routing of onshore cables, and siting of
the interconnection switchyard.1144
Shell, Dominion, and CREA and NewSun argue that the high cost of market entry
for offshore wind projects is a substantial financial commitment and that such generating

facilities are by their very nature not speculative.1145 Shell argues that offshore wind
generation should be able to demonstrate site control by showing evidence of
commitments to purchase offshore lease areas from BOEM, as commitments often
demand hundreds of millions of dollars.1146
CREA and NewSun contend that the site control requirements in the NOPR would
require an offshore developer to win a competitive solicitation or obtain a term sheet
from an off-taker before entering the interconnection queue, which at best will add years
of delay to developing these generating facilities and at worst will kill the proposals
outright due to a lack of information on interconnection feasibility and cost.1147
MISO notes that it has not interpreted its tariff to mean that a BOEM-administered
Wind Energy Area auction that an offshore wind interconnection customer can
participate in, but which will occur after the close of an application window, is a
regulatory restriction.1148 MISO is concerned that broadening the regulatory restriction
interpretation to allow for offshore wind to submit an interconnection request in such
instances would enable speculative interconnection requests, which will result in
withdrawals, restudies, uncertainty, and study delays. MISO states that interconnection

customers that seek to develop a generating facility on government owned lands that are
awarded to the winner of an auction, and interconnection customers that seek to develop
a generating facility on private land, are held to the same standard in the MISO process.
Some commenters request that “regulatory limitations” be more clearly
defined.1149 CAISO expresses concern that, absent clarification, the regulatory limitation
provision will leave transmission provider staff as adjudicators of whether obtaining site
control is possible for each proposed generating facility, and interconnection staff are not
experts on real property law or public permitting requirements.1150 CAISO and Indicated
PJM TOs argue that without further clarification, the regulatory limitation provision may
be interpreted too broadly and interconnection customers could argue site control was
impossible where it was simply impractical or expensive.1151 CAISO suggests, as an
example, that the Commission could limit “regulatory limitations” only to apply to
interconnection customers sited in offshore areas, public lands, and Tribal lands.1152
Several parties support the NOPR proposal to allow interconnection customers
with regulatory limitations to submit a deposit in lieu of site control.1153 For projects on

government lands, Indicated PJM TOs argue that the interconnection customer should be
allowed to enter and remain in the interconnection queue, with a deposit in lieu of site
control, if they identify the steps needed to achieve site control and show how they are
exercising due diligence to obtain a final government determination.1154 Indicated PJM
TOs argue that the regulatory limitations exception should be limited to just government
lands.
MISO supports such an option specifically when the interconnection customer is
prevented from obtaining site control by a regulatory restriction that the passage of time
itself will not cure (e.g., while participating in an auction that occurs after the
interconnection request deadline can be cured by time, a requirement to obtain an LGIA
to participate in an auction cannot be cured by time).1155
Tri-State suggests modifying section 3.4.[1]2 of the pro forma LGIP so that the
site control for state or federally controlled land must still be fully attained at the time of
LGIA execution.1156 For example, Tri-State states that in Colorado, a state land planning
lease (which does not meet the Commission’s proposed definition of site control) could
be used with a financial deposit during the cluster study process, and a state land

production lease (which does meet the Commission’s proposed definition of site control)
would be needed prior to LGIA execution.1157
APPA-LPPC argue that, if the NOPR proposal is adopted, at a minimum, the
interconnection customer should be required to provide an affidavit from a company
officer, a detailed explanation, and documentation justifying the proposed regulatory
limitation exception and to demonstrate 100% site control as soon as possible after the
generator interconnection request is submitted, and certainly prior to the facilities study
stage, as the NOPR proposes.1158 PPL contends that, while additional flexibility for
interconnection customers that face regulatory limitation may be appropriate in the early
stages of review, the Commission should require that full site control be demonstrated
before proceeding to an LGIA.1159
A number of commenters oppose the NOPR’s proposed option to allow deposits in
lieu of site control where federal or state regulatory limitations prohibit the

financial limitations and extra deposits would not act as the same deterrent as requiring
100% site control; therefore, APS requests that the Commission not allow an exception
for regulatory restrictions.1162
OSPA argues that requiring interconnection customers that face regulatory barriers
to submit any deposits, including deposits in lieu of site control, will create insuperable
barriers to renewable energy development by Native American Tribes and Tribal Energy
Development Organizations on Tribal lands,1163 stating that Tribes have limited access to
capital and face other challenges that large developers do not share.1164
A few commenters support the proposed amounts for the deposit in lieu of site
control.1165 MISO agrees that the proposed deposit thresholds are sufficient, noting that
the amount of the deposits under MISO’s tariff are the same amounts the Commission
proposed in the NOPR.1166 Tri-State contends that the proposed deposit amounts would

be sufficient to ensure advanced-stage interconnection requests are able to continue to
move toward interconnection.1167
Several parties support a deposit in lieu of site control high enough to deter
speculative interconnection requests that are unlikely to achieve site control.1168
Avangrid argues that any deposit in lieu of site control should be proportionate to the size
of the interconnection request, and “reflect collateral” while an interconnection customer
works through site control agreements.1169 Eversource similarly argues that the
Commission should set the deposit so that the interconnection customer fully internalizes
the risk of failing to obtain site control.1170 Tri-State also argues that the deposit should
not apply to interconnection study costs.1171
Some commenters provide alternative suggestions for the deposit in lieu of site
control amounts.1172 Longroad Energy argues that the Commission should consider
requiring that such deposits be set as a multiple of the interconnection study deposit (such
as three times the deposit amount), rather than as a dollar amount per MW of generating

generating facility is not necessarily relevant to determining the appropriate deposit
requirement and that deposits should be more closely tied to the generating facility’s
potential impact on the interconnection process.1174
A number of entities argue that any deposits in lieu of site control should be nonrefundable.1175 Avangrid suggests that the deposit be non-refundable to avoid gaming by
prospective interconnection customers.1176 National Grid argues that absent
circumstances outside the control of the interconnection customer, any deposit should be
non-refundable, and any security should be able to be drawn upon in the event the
interconnection customer withdraws or fails to demonstrate site control at the required
time.1177 National Grid contends that if the Commission intends to permit refunds or
returns of a deposit in lieu of site control, such deposits should be provided only after
deducting the actual costs and fees, e.g., escrow account initiation and maintenance fees,
incurred by the transmission provider or RTOs/ISOs prior to the time of the withdrawal

request or the demonstration of site control. National Grid also requests that the
Commission clarify that withdrawal penalties are separate and may be deducted from the
deposit amount.
Similarly, Longroad Energy suggests that to ensure that the proper incentives
exist, the Commission may wish to evaluate if a security deposit in lieu of site control
should become non-refundable if an interconnection customer withdraws at any point in
the interconnection process or fails to achieve commercial operation.1178 EEI argues that
the Commission can further reduce potential risks by making deposits non-refundable, or
if the Commission declines to do so, it should ensure that withdrawal penalties are
significant enough to discourage speculative interconnection requests.1179 On the other
hand, NYTOs argue that regions should have the flexibility to determine whether, under
certain circumstances, deposits should become fully non-refundable.1180
Xcel argues that in addition to requiring a deposit, interconnection customers
facing regulatory limitations should be required to provide status updates to the
transmission provider, and there should be sufficient penalties to ensure interconnection
customers provide accurate information on the status of regulatory proceedings.1181 Xcel

that facilitate interconnection, including the ultimate achievement of site control.
(c)

Miscellaneous

Public Interest Organizations argue that it is unreasonable that the pro forma LGIP
allows interconnection customers to propose a decrease to the generating facility’s output
of up to 60% without losing queue position while also requiring a demonstration of 100%
site control upon entering the interconnection queue.1182 Public Interest Organizations
also argue that the NOPR proposal to require interconnection customers to remedy any
change in site control within 10 days or have their interconnection request withdrawn is
unreasonable. In addition, Public Interest Organizations argue that it is unduly
discriminatory to allow interconnection customers proposing a thermal project to keep
their queue position by downsizing the generating facility’s turbines but not allow
interconnection customers proposing wind generating facilities to keep their queue
position if they lose part of a lease. Public Interest Organizations argue that the cure
period should be long enough to allow for routine events that affect site control, such as
the death of a landowner or the change of ownership at a commercial facility hosting a
proposed generating facility.

pro forma LGIA to add more stringency to the site control requirements and to help
prevent speculative interconnection requests from entering the interconnection queue.
We believe that, taken together, these reforms will help ensure that commercially viable
interconnection requests with demonstrated site control or with demonstrated regulatory
limitations will be able to enter the interconnection queue, thereby reducing the negative
impacts of speculative interconnection requests.
(a)

Definition and Reasonable Evidence of Site
Control

We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise the definition of site control in section 1 of
the pro forma LGIP with several modifications. As modified, the definition states that
site control may be demonstrated by documentation establishing: “(1) ownership of, a
leasehold interest in, or a right to develop a site of sufficient size to construct and operate
the Generating Facility; (2) an option to purchase or acquire a leasehold site of sufficient
size to construct and operate the Generating Facility; or (3) any other documentation that
clearly demonstrates the right of Interconnection Customer to exclusively occupy a site of
sufficient size to construct and operate the Generating Facility.” Additionally, we agree
with commenters’ observations1183 that subpart (3) of the pro forma LGIP definition of
site control proposed in the NOPR, which stated “site of sufficient size to construct and
operate the Generating Facility,” was duplicative; therefore, we modify the NOPR
proposal to delete this subpart and provide clarification that all three remaining,

enumerated options to demonstrate site control require control of a site of sufficient size
to construct and operate the generating facility or multiple generating facilities on a
shared site.
To prevent multiple interconnection customers from leasing the same site in order
to remain in the interconnection queue, we adopt the NOPR’s proposed revisions to the
pro forma LGIP that require an interconnection customer to demonstrate the exclusive
land right to develop, construct, operate, and maintain its generating facility or, where
facilities are co-located, to demonstrate a shared land use right to develop, construct,
operate, and maintain co-located facilities. We further clarify that the right to
“exclusively” occupy the site to develop, construct, operate, or maintain a generating
facility means both that the right belongs solely to the interconnection customer (no other
entity shares the right to use the site for those purposes), as well as that the right is solely
for purposes of a single interconnection request. We find that an interconnection
customer securing the exclusive land right necessary to construct its proposed generating
facility (or for co-located generating facilities, demonstration of shared land use) is
sufficient evidence of the interconnection customer’s commitment to construct the
generating facility.
We also modify section 3.4.2 of the pro forma LGIP to provide that site control
for a generating facility that is co-located with one or more generating facilities on the
same site and behind the same point of interconnection must be demonstrated by a
contract or other agreement that allows for shared land use for all generating facilities
that are co-located that meet the provisions of the site control definition. We clarify that

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 393 -

interconnection customers are prohibited from submitting evidence of site control that
uses the same land for multiple interconnection requests, unless the site is large enough to
host multiple generating facilities. We note that section 3.4.2 of the pro forma LGIP that
we adopt in this final rule permits shared land use for co-located generating facilities on
the same site and behind the same point of interconnection, and we clarify below that
transmission providers have flexibility to establish appropriate technology-specific
acreage requirements for generating facilities.1184 Permitting multiple interconnection
requests to use the same land to demonstrate exclusive site control would inherently
result in at least one commercially non-viable interconnection request entering the
interconnection queue and thus would be insufficient to ensure that interconnection
customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner. We also clarify that the interconnection customer is
required to meet the technology-specific acreage requirement for its generating facility
that is publicly posted by the transmission provider at the time it submits its
interconnection request.
Likewise, in response to Enel, we clarify that the term “exclusive land rights” in
the definition of site control applies only to the exclusivity required to develop, construct,
operate, and maintain the interconnection customer’s proposed generating facility; the

term “exclusive land rights” does not restrict multi-use applications of the site in addition
to its use for the generating facility, such as agriculture, ranching, etc.1185 Similarly, in
response to Cypress Creek, we clarify that a land right does not involve zoning approval.
In response to commenters,1186 we further clarify that the adopted definition of site
control permits an interconnection customer to demonstrate site control with lease
options, instead of executed leases, provided that the interconnection customer is the
exclusive holder of such a lease option(s). The adopted definition explicitly provides for
such a lease option, by including the phrase, “an option to purchase or acquire a leasehold
site.” However, evidence of active negotiations for a lease is not a sufficient
demonstration of site control at any time during the interconnection process. Allowing
active negotiations for a lease to serve as a demonstration of site control, as some
commenters suggest,1187 would allow speculative, commercially non-viable
interconnection requests to proceed through the interconnection queue, which would be
inconsistent with ensuring that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the
transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. Likewise,
with respect to NRECA’s request,1188 we clarify that this final rule permits leases and

lease options as sufficient evidence of site control as discussed above, and transmission
providers have discretion to evaluate the content of such leases and lease options and any
conditions contained therein to determine whether they sufficiently demonstrate site
control.
Several commenters seek clarification as to whether the proposed pro forma LGIP
definition of site control would allow certain types of generating facilities developed on
lands owned or controlled by a government entity to demonstrate site control. We agree
with commenters that offshore wind interconnection customers must make a substantial
financial commitment to win a competitive auction and secure a lease from BOEM, and
such generating facilities that have secured a lease agreement are not speculative.1189 We
therefore clarify that a lease agreement with BOEM to pursue development of an offshore
wind generating facility can serve as a sufficient demonstration of site control under the
site control definition adopted in this final rule. This clarification is consistent with our
finding above that a variety of lease options satisfy the site control requirement. In
response to MISO’s concerns about allowing multiple offshore wind interconnection
customers to submit an interconnection request for the same “Wind Energy Area” before
it has been auctioned by BOEM, we find that the pro forma LGIP site control definition
that we adopt herein appropriately limits such potentially speculative interconnection

requests by requiring offshore wind interconnection customers to provide evidence of an
exclusive right to develop a lease area to satisfy the site control requirements.
With respect to OSPA’s concerns regarding the challenges of demonstrating site
control on Tribal lands due to the nature of land ownership on Reservations and the need
for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to approve certain leases, we clarify that under the site
control definition, interconnection customers developing generating facilities on Tribal
lands can demonstrate site control with a signed lease agreement with the applicable
Tribe-owner.1190 As discussed below in Section III.A.6.b.iii.b, an interconnection
customer with a demonstrated regulatory limitation, including those associated with
obtaining a lease on Tribal lands, may submit a deposit in lieu of site control.
Similarly, in response to commenters’ concerns about demonstrating site control
for hydropower projects on sites owned or controlled by a government entity, we clarify
that certain documentation can be used to demonstrate site control under the pro forma
LGIP definition of site control. For interconnection customers developing generating
facilities at non-powered dams, we clarify that a FERC license1191 can serve as a
demonstration of site control under subpart (3). However, we also clarify that neither a

A FERC license provides the licensee with the power of eminent domain to
secure property rights needed to construct and operate the project. See 16 U.S.C. 814.
While a FERC license does not explicitly convey an exclusive right to develop a project,
the Commission does not approve more than one license for the same site.

proposed hydropower project at a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam nor a preliminary
permit for a pumped storage project or other hydropower generating facility to be located
on Tribal lands would be sufficient to demonstrate site control because we do not have
enough information in this record to determine that such documentation provides
sufficient evidence of the interconnection customer’s exclusive right to occupy a site of
sufficient size to construct and operate a generating facility.
For hydropower projects that are not subject to the Commission’s hydropower
permitting jurisdiction, such as projects on Bureau of Reclamation lands, we clarify that a
lease of power privilege can serve as a demonstration of site control under the site control
definition. Finally, for hydropower projects that are small enough to be exempted from
FERC licensing requirements, Hydropower Commenters explain that an exemption from
FERC licensing provides an exclusive right to the recipient to develop a project at the site
and the exemption is issued in perpetuity.1192 Because such an exemption includes an
exclusive right to develop, we clarify that providing a written statement as evidence of an
exemption from licensing under the FPA can serve as a demonstration of site control
under subpart (3) of the site control definition.
We note NV Energy’s explanation that its previous efforts to allow
interconnection customers to demonstrate site control by showing a draft preliminary
plan of development, one of the earlier required documents in the BLM permitting
process, have led to speculative interconnection requests that slow down the

interconnection process.1193 We agree, and we therefore decline to adopt commenters’
proposal to modify the proposed pro forma LGIP definition of site control to allow
interconnection customers to demonstrate site control by providing documentation
indicating that they are pursuing the necessary permits with the appropriate government
entity or entities.1194 As with our finding that active negotiations for lease agreements are
not sufficient to demonstrate site control, discussed above, we find that such an
expansion of the site control definition could weaken the site control requirements
included in the pro forma LGIP and could undermine the effectiveness of this reform in
helping to prevent speculative interconnection requests.

Site Control Demonstration and Deposits in
Lieu of Site Control

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to revise section 3.4.2 of the pro
forma LGIP to require interconnection customers to demonstrate site control at the time
of submission of the interconnection request. However, we modify the proposal and
require interconnection customers to provide evidence of 90% site control for the
generating facility at the time of submission of the interconnection request and, pursuant
to revised sections 8.1 and 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP, provide evidence of 100% site
control for the generating facility at the time of execution of the facilities study
agreement and when executing, or requesting the unexecuted filing of, the LGIA.

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to require technology-specific acreages to
be listed in the transmission provider’s tariff. As discussed below, instead, we require
transmission providers to establish acreage requirements for each generating facility
technology type and to publicly post these acreage requirements. We adopt the following
aspects of the NOPR proposal to revise sections 3.4.2 and 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP to:
(1) eliminate the option to provide a deposit in lieu of site control demonstration except
in limited circumstances where an interconnection customer demonstrates a regulatory
limitation to obtaining site control, as discussed below, and eliminate the option to post
$250,000 of non-refundable security in lieu of site control at LGIA execution; and
(2) require that interconnection customers that could not demonstrate the requisite level
of site control at the relevant milestone of the interconnection process (i.e., 90% for the
cluster study and cluster restudy, and 100% for the interconnection facilities study and
when executing, or requesting the unexecuted filing of, the LGIA) would have their
interconnection request deemed withdrawn and could be subject to withdrawal penalties
under certain circumstances, as discussed below.
We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise sections 3.4.2, 7.5 and 8.1 of the pro forma
LGIP such that, after notifying the transmission provider of any change to the
interconnection customer’s site control demonstration, the transmission provider must
give the interconnection customer 10 business days to demonstrate satisfaction with the
applicable requirement. We find the adopted approach to require 90% site control at the
time of the interconnection request and 100% site control at the time of the facilities
study and when executing, or requesting the unexecuted filing of, the LGIA appropriately

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

balances the concerns identified in the record. In particular, we find that it will provide
sufficiently stringent site control requirements to help prevent interconnection customers
from submitting interconnection requests for speculative, commercially non-viable
proposed generating facilities, while accommodating development challenges faced by
interconnection customers that may otherwise present unjust and unreasonable barriers to
entering the interconnection queue. We believe that this approach appropriately
recognizes that issues often arise in developing a generating facility, such that requiring a
demonstration of 90% site control at the time of the interconnection request, rather than
100%, provides valuable flexibility for interconnection customers with viable prospective
generating facilities to resolve those issues and continue through the interconnection
process.
We are persuaded by commenters that contend that there are significant benefits to
allowing interconnection customers to enter the cluster study process and potentially use
the interconnection study results to better understand their generating facility
configuration before obtaining 100% site control. We agree with commenters that
allowing less than 100% site control at the interconnection request stage would provide
interconnection customers flexibility to address the results of interconnection studies or
other regulatory processes1195 and afford flexibility for interconnection customers that are
still actively negotiating with landowners close to the deadline for a cluster request

window.1196 Establishing a requirement for 90% site control at the time of an
interconnection request allows an interconnection request to be submitted even if a few
parcels of land are still in negotiation or where a different site configuration arises based
on the scoping meeting with the transmission provider. Moreover, the adopted approach
provides flexibility for interconnection customers to sign certain leases for particularly
challenging parcels at a later point in time, reducing the exposure to risk of expiration of
those leases.1197 Additionally, we agree with commenters that shifting the 100% site
control requirement until the execution of a facilities study agreement allows the
interconnection customer to put less money at risk for obtaining particularly challenging
land rights and to obtain a more meaningful understanding of what upgrade costs its
generating facility may be assigned, for instance, from the cluster study report that is
provided before the execution of the facilities study agreement.1198
At the same time, we believe that the approach adopted in this final rule, along
with the other reforms adopted herein, is sufficiently stringent to help prevent
speculative, commercially non-viable proposed generating facilities from entering and
continuing through the interconnection queue. As an initial matter, we establish a more
stringent requirement for site control at the time of submission of an interconnection

request than required by the pro forma LGIP prior to this final rule. In particular,
obtaining nearly all of the land rights necessary to develop a proposed generating facility
prior to submitting the interconnection request entails a significant commitment, both
financial and in terms of the time and resources required to negotiate with landowners.
Moreover, the 100% site control requirement at the time of the execution of the facilities
study agreement adds further stringency to ensure generating facilities that proceed
through the interconnection queue are the most likely to be commercially viable.
We agree with commenters that requiring 100% site control at the time of
submission of an interconnection request may not be compatible with the project
development cycle,1199 which includes stringent permitting requirements, and may
disadvantage certain interconnection customers despite there being a path to full site
control and commercial readiness.1200 Further, requiring 100% site control at submission
of the interconnection request would not allow for minor revisions to the generating
facility plan if, upon meeting with the transmission provider at the scoping meeting, such
revisions would facilitate an improved generating facility design. This could present a
barrier to entry for interconnection customers with viable proposed generating facilities.

We decline to adopt commenters’ suggestions that transmission providers be
allowed to confirm site control throughout the interconnection process.1201 The adopted
site control requirements require site control demonstrations at three specific points in the
interconnection process—submission of the interconnection request; at the time of
execution of the facilities study agreement; and when executing, or requesting the
unexecuted filing of, an LGIA. We find that these points are sufficient to help prevent
interconnection customers with commercially non-viable interconnection requests from
entering and proceeding through the interconnection queue.
With respect to eliminating the option for any interconnection customer to submit
a deposit in lieu of site control, except in limited circumstances where an interconnection
customer demonstrates a regulatory limitation, we find that, because a deposit in lieu of
site control does not demonstrate that an interconnection customer has the exclusive right
to develop a site, it does not indicate that an interconnection customer is ready to proceed
with construction and commercial operation of the generating facility. As a result, we
believe that allowing deposits in lieu of site control for all interconnection customers, as
requested by some commenters, would not help to prevent speculative, commercially
non-viable interconnection requests from entering the interconnection queue. Thus, we
decline to include such an option in the pro forma LGIP.
We are persuaded by commenters that requiring transmission providers to publicly
maintain per MW acreage requirements for each generating facility technology type is

necessary to afford adequate transparency and certainty to interconnection customers. At
the same time, we do not believe that such acreage requirements must be contained
within transmission providers’ tariffs; rather, we find that, consistent with the rule of
reason, transmission providers may choose to maintain acreage requirements in their
business practice manuals or may otherwise post them on a publicly accessible website.
We find that acreage requirements are properly classified as implementation details that
do not significantly affect rates, terms, and conditions of service,1202 and we therefore do
not require their inclusion in tariffs. This is consistent with previous Commission orders
approving transmission providers’ proposals to specify technology-specific acreage
requirements for site control in their business practice manuals.1203 This will also afford
transmission providers more flexibility in updating acreage requirements to account for
technological advancements without being required to make FPA section 205 filings each
time they seek to modify the acreage requirements. On the other hand, to give the
interconnection customer certainty, as noted above, we clarify that the interconnection
customer is required to meet the technology-specific acreage requirement for its
generating facility publicly posted by the transmission provider at the time it submits its
interconnection request.

To provide clarity for interconnection customers and transmission providers, we
modify the pro forma LGIP definition of “Generating Facility” to replace “device” with
“device(s)” to clarify that this definition includes hybrid generating facilities.1204 We
believe this clarification is necessary to ensure that hybrid generating facilities have the
same rights and responsibilities as other types of generating facilities under the pro forma
LGIP and pro forma LGIA. In response to commenters and consistent with the modified
definition of “Generating Facility,” we clarify that the transmission providers’ per MW
acreage requirements for each generating facility technology-type must include specific
requirements for hybrid generating facilities. We also clarify that generating facilities
that are co-located on the same site and behind the same point of interconnection are
subject to the technology-specific acreage requirements based on the generating facilities’
technology-type.
In response to requests for clarification as to whether the site control
demonstration at the time of submission of the interconnection request applies to
interconnection facilities as well as generating facilities, we clarify that the site control
demonstration requirements apply only to the land needed for the generating facility. In
the NOPR, the Commission did not propose site control requirements for interconnection

Site Control Considerations for
Interconnection Customers with Regulatory
Limitations

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to revise section 3.4.2 of the pro
forma LGIP to include a limited option for interconnection customers to submit a deposit
in lieu of site control when they submit their interconnection request—only if qualifying
regulatory limitations prohibit the interconnection customer from obtaining site control.
We adopt the NOPR proposal to provide that interconnection customers with regulatory
limitations may submit an initial deposit in lieu of site control of $10,000 per MW,
subject to a floor of $500,000 and a ceiling of $2 million. As discussed below, this
deposit shall be refundable but may not be applied toward interconnection studies or
withdrawal penalties, if applicable. However, we decline to adopt the proposed
requirement in the NOPR that an interconnection customer facing regulatory limitations
must demonstrate 100% site control prior to the execution of a facilities study agreement.
Instead, we modify the proposed requirement for an interconnection customer facing

1205

Under the pro forma LGIP, interconnection facilities shall mean the
transmission provider’s interconnection facilities and the interconnection customer’s
interconnection facilities. Collectively, interconnection facilities include all facilities and
equipment between the generating facility and the point of interconnection, including any
modification, additions or upgrades that are necessary to physically and electrically
interconnect the generating facility to the transmission provider’s transmission system.
Interconnection facilities are sole use facilities and shall not include distribution
upgrades, stand alone network upgrades or network upgrades.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

regulatory limitations to provide that a deposit in lieu of site control will be accepted and
held by the transmission provider until the interconnection customer can demonstrate
90% site control prior to execution of the facilities study agreement or 100% site control
at execution of the facilities study agreement or thereafter. Additionally, we modify the
NOPR proposal to specify in Appendix B of the pro forma LGIA that interconnection
customers facing qualifying regulatory limitations must demonstrate 100% site control
within 180 calendar days of the effective date of the LGIA or the LGIA may be
terminated per article 17 (Default) of the pro forma LGIA and the interconnection
customer may be subject to withdrawal penalties per new pro forma LGIP section 3.7.1.1
(Calculation of the Withdrawal Penalty).
We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise section 3.4.2 of the pro forma LGIP to
provide how interconnection customers may demonstrate regulatory limitations.
Specifically interconnection customers must provide to the transmission provider: (1) a
signed affidavit from an officer of the company indicating that site control is
unobtainable due to regulatory limitations as such term is defined by the transmission
provider; and (2) documentation sufficiently describing and explaining the source and
effects of such regulatory limitations, including a description of any conditions that must
be met to satisfy the regulatory limitations and the anticipated time by which the
interconnection customer expects to satisfy the regulatory restrictions.
With respect to what qualifies as a regulatory limitation, we require transmission
providers to define regulatory limitations relevant to their service territory, to publicly
post the definition, and to provide a narrative description of how they define regulatory

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 408 -

limitations as part of their compliance filings. While we decline to require a uniform
definition of regulatory limitations for all transmission providers, we clarify that a
regulatory limitation is generally a federal, state, Tribal, or local law that makes it
practically infeasible to obtain site control within the time frame detailed in the pro forma
LGIP. We allow transmission providers flexibility on how to publicly post the definition,
such as by including it in business practice manuals or posting on a publicly accessible
website. We consider the definition of regulatory limitations to be an implementation
detail appropriately housed outside of transmission providers’ tariffs, consistent with the
rule of reason. We expect that the appropriate scope of regulatory limitations may vary
by region and is likely to need to be updated over time as relevant federal, state, Tribal or
local laws change. For these reasons, we do not require transmission providers to include
their definitions of regulatory limitations in their tariffs.
We believe that these requirements will ensure a transparent, consistent, and
orderly process to facilitate demonstration of regulatory limitations by interconnection
customers and will establish minimum requirements to provide transmission providers
sufficient information to evaluate such demonstrations. We agree with commenters that
transmission providers are best positioned to develop appropriate definitions of
regulatory limitations to address the specific circumstances and unique regulatory
limitations that interconnection customers in their regions may face. We believe that this
approach preserves flexibility for transmission providers to account for regional diversity.
As noted above, we decline to adopt the proposed requirement in the NOPR that
an interconnection customer facing regulatory limitations must demonstrate 100% site

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 409 -

control prior to commencement of the facilities study. We agree with commenters that
the requirement to demonstrate site control at the facilities study stage could act as a
barrier for generating facilities faced with regulatory limitations in demonstrating site
control because the permitting process may still be underway at the facilities study
stage.1206 To account for these barriers, we clarify that, in such circumstances,
interconnection customers are permitted to proceed through the interconnection process
and execute, or request the unexecuted filing of, an LGIA before obtaining site control,
by providing documentation that demonstrates they are taking identifiable steps to secure
the necessary regulatory approvals from the applicable federal, state, and/or Tribal
entities, as described above. Such interconnection customers must provide this
documentation at the time of execution of the facilities study agreement and when
executing, or requesting the unexecuted filing of, the LGIA, or alternatively, demonstrate
site control in accordance with the requirements of the pro forma LGIP.
We acknowledge that certain interconnection customers developing generating
facilities on sites owned or controlled by a government entity, such as those who site
generating facilities on BLM lands, may not be able to demonstrate site control under the
pro forma LGIP definition even by the later stages of the interconnection process because
final permitting approval from BLM may not occur until after the facilities study
stage.1207 We believe the site control requirements included in the pro forma LGIP strike

an appropriate balance between disincentivizing speculative interconnection requests and
accommodating interconnection customers facing extensive permitting requirements by
allowing such customers to submit a deposit in lieu of site control where they
demonstrate a qualifying regulatory limitation.
In response to commenters’ concerns that, without clarification, the regulatory
limitations exception to the site control requirement may be interpreted broadly to allow
interconnection customers to claim regulatory limitations when obtaining site control is
simply impractical or expensive, we reiterate that transmission providers may exercise
discretion when defining regulatory limitations—generally a federal, state, Tribal, or
local law that makes it practically infeasible to obtain site control within the time frame
detailed in the pro forma LGIP—as appropriate for interconnection customers in their
regions. We believe that allowing flexibility in defining regulatory limitations will
enable transmission providers to account for any local, county, Tribal and state
regulations in their respective region that may delay an interconnection customer’s efforts
to obtain site control.
With respect to the amount of the deposit in lieu of site control for interconnection
customers with regulatory limitations, we find that the amounts that we adopt in this final
rule will help prevent speculative interconnection requests without placing an undue
burden on interconnection customers. We are not persuaded by commenters that argue
that the deposit amounts in lieu of site control for interconnection customers with
regulatory limitations need to be even higher to deter interconnection requests that are not
likely to achieve site control, particularly when considered in conjunction with the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 411 -

commercial readiness deposits and withdrawal penalties adopted in this final rule,
discussed below. We also find that deposits in lieu of site control for interconnection
customers with regulatory limitations should be refundable, but may not be applied
toward interconnection studies or withdrawal penalties. We find that making these
deposits in lieu of site control for interconnection customers with regulatory limitations
non-refundable, as some commenters argue, may unduly burden certain interconnection
customers facing regulatory limitations where certain regulatory constraints may be
beyond their control.

Commercial Readiness
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to include a
commercial readiness framework, which included commercial readiness demonstration
options and commercial readiness deposits.1208 The Commission explained that such a
framework would encourage interconnection customers that are not ready to proceed to
withdraw from the interconnection queue earlier in the study process while also providing
them the flexibility to enter and remain in the interconnection queue without an off-take
agreement; reduce the number of times an interconnection customer executes and
suspends an LGIA for a speculative interconnection request, only to later withdraw the
request, leading to the shifting of network upgrade costs to lower-queued interconnection
customers; and reduce the strain on transmission providers and enable viable

interconnection requests to progress more quickly through a less congested
interconnection queue, thereby remedying the unjust and unreasonable Commissionjurisdictional rates discussed in Section II of this final rule.
Therefore, the Commission proposed to establish the defined terms “commercial

LGIP.1211 The Commission also proposed to add to sections 3.4.2, 7.5, and 8.1 of the pro

demonstration to enter into the cluster study and cluster restudy:
An executed term sheet (or comparable evidence) related to a contract,
binding upon the parties to the contract, for sale of (1) the constructed generating
facility, (2) the generating facility’s energy or capacity, or (3) the generating
facility’s ancillary services; where the term of sale is not less than five years;
Reasonable evidence that the generating facility has been selected in a
resource plan or resource solicitation process by or for a load-serving entity (LSE),

The Commission also proposed to add to section 8.1 of the pro forma LGIP the
following options to serve as forms of commercial readiness demonstration to enter the
facilities study, to be provided with the executed facilities study agreement:
An executed contract (as opposed to a term sheet), binding upon the parties
to the contract, for sale of (1) the constructed generating facility, (2) the generating
facility’s energy or capacity, or (3) the generating facility’s ancillary services;
where the term of sale is not less than five years;
Reasonable evidence that the generating facility has been selected in a
resource plan or resource solicitation process by or for an LSE, is being developed
by an LSE, or is being developed for purposes of a sale to a commercial,
industrial, or other large end-use customer; or
A provisional LGIA accepted for filing by the Commission, which is not
suspended, with reasonable evidence that the generating facility and
interconnection facilities have commenced design and engineering.1212

The Commission also proposed to require the interconnection customer to inform
the transmission provider of any material change to its commercial readiness
demonstration. The Commission proposed to require the transmission provider to give
the interconnection customer 10 business days to demonstrate satisfaction with the
applicable requirement after notification of a change to the interconnection request’s
commercial readiness demonstration.1213 The Commission explained that the
interconnection customer would have the option to submit a commercial readiness
deposit within the 10-day cure period if the change to the commercial readiness
demonstration meant that the interconnection request no longer satisfied the criteria.
The Commission preliminarily concluded that this approach was appropriate for
all transmission providers and therefore proposed to allow interconnection customers the
option to submit a commercial readiness deposit, in lieu of demonstrating commercial
readiness through the commercial readiness demonstration options required to enter a
cluster study, cluster restudy, and facilities study.1214 The Commission noted that,
outside of RTOs/ISOs, transmission providers may be able to provide certain contractual
arrangements to their own generating facilities or other preferred interconnection
customers, such as the term sheet option noted above, which could lead to unduly
discriminatory behavior. The Commission stated that this deposit in lieu of
demonstrating commercial readiness may potentially prevent any undue discrimination in

the generator interconnection process, consistent with the adoption of a standard set of
procedures in the first instance.1215
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to include a framework
to allow interconnection customers to provide a commercial readiness deposit in lieu of
meeting commercial readiness requirements in the following amounts:
Two times the study deposit amount to enter the initial cluster study phase;
Five times the study deposit amount after the initial cluster study phase and
before the system impact restudy phase; and
Seven times the study deposit amount after receipt of the facilities study
agreement.1216
The Commission clarified that the proposed commercial readiness deposit is
separate from the study deposit.1217 The Commission stated that the commercial
readiness deposit would be returned if the interconnection customer later makes a
commercial readiness demonstration. If the interconnection customer withdraws from
the interconnection queue, the Commission proposed that the commercial readiness
deposit would be applied toward any incurred withdrawal penalties.
Additionally, the Commission proposed revisions to the list of development
milestones in section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP to clarify the following:

 A contract for the supply or transportation of fuel and a contract for the supply of
cooling water will not be accepted for wind, storage, or solar photovoltaic

 Comparable evidence of a contract for the sale of energy or capacity will be

 Any of the commercial readiness demonstration options accepted to enter the
facilities study will be accepted along with the executed LGIA or within 15 days
of the Commission issuing an order on the unexecuted LGIA filing, while a
commercial readiness deposit will not be accepted.1218
The Commission preliminarily found that this framework would allow
interconnection customers to calculate the exact deposit that would be required prior to
entering the interconnection queue, as it is based on multiples of the study deposit, and
the study deposit is based on the size of the proposed generating facility, as chosen by the
interconnection customer, leading to predictability in the deposit amount.1219 The
Commission explained that this increased transparency in the deposit amount early in the
interconnection process would discourage speculative interconnection requests from
entering the interconnection queue.

establish, as other alternative demonstrations of commercial readiness, evidence of a

Comments in Support

Several commenters support the commercial readiness framework because they
believe that it will reduce the submission of exploratory or speculative interconnection
requests.1221 These commenters argue that requiring financial commitments and
commercial readiness requirements early in the interconnection process, as the
Commission proposed, is important to more efficiently allocate transmission provider
resources to generating facilities that are more likely to achieve commercial operation

and to enhance the certainty of interconnection study results, benefiting all
interconnection customers. Pacific Northwest Utilities similarly assert that requiring
commercial readiness at an appropriate point in the cluster study process minimizes the
cost and inefficiency risk of restudies and increases the probability that planned network
upgrades will be funded and constructed.1222 Navajo Utility also supports the
Commission’s use of the commercial readiness requirements to discourage speculative
interconnection requests from slowing the interconnection process.1223
Navajo Utility explains that, as an LSE that constructs generating facilities for the
benefit of the Navajo Nation and to export clean energy to surrounding LSEs, it
specifically supports the second criterion related to generating facilities developed by an
LSE.1224 NRECA contends that the proposed commercial readiness demonstration
requirements protect generating facilities that have been committed to serve load from
being hindered by interconnection requests for generating facilities that are still looking
for off-takers, thereby helping reduce the pressure on transmission provider
interconnection queues.1225

knowledge of interconnection costs before deals may be finalized.1226 However, APPALPPC argue that there is nothing inevitable about the structure and sequencing of these
arrangements. APPA-LPPC state that, assuming the Commission moves ahead with a
commercial readiness requirement, it is not hard to envision revisions to standard form
power purchase agreements, asset sales agreements, and bids into power procurement
programs that are contingent on specified assumptions regarding interconnection costs.
APPA-LPPC contend that with improvements in the availability of interconnection costs,
along with much-needed stability in the interconnection queues, it is reasonable to expect
that interconnection costs will be substantially more predictable than is now the case.
SoCal Edison supports the proposals to require the interconnection customer to
notify the transmission provider of any material change to its commercial readiness
demonstration and to require the transmission provider to give the interconnection
customer 10 business days to cure the commercial readiness deficiency.1227
(b)

Comments in Opposition

Several commenters argue that the NOPR proposal is inconsistent with prevailing
commercial practices (especially those in RTOs/ISOs), sets unreasonable standards for
off-take agreements, and ignores the commercial reality of the competitive solicitation
process, which could create an undue preference for self-build options in areas that rely
on competitive solicitations and undue discrimination against merchant developers,

thereby subverting competition in wholesale power markets.1228 Some commenters
contend that the proposed commercial readiness demonstration options are heavily
weighted in favor of incumbent utility practices, such as evidence of a power purchase
agreement or executed term sheet or evidence that a project has been selected in a
resource plan or resource solicitation process by an LSE.1229
Enel argues that ratepayers and off-takers benefit from generating facilities being
selected in competitive processes that consider both a generating facility’s inherent
characteristics and its interconnection costs and schedule, which cannot be done if offtake arrangements are made prior to applying for interconnection service.1230 NextEra
asserts that being part of the interconnection queue is an essential step in the competitive
process,1231 and Public Interest Organizations note that utilities conducting RFPs for their
resource plans often require at least a position in an interconnection queue as a

precondition of offering.1232 Cypress Creek argues that commercial readiness
demonstrations should not apply until an interconnection customer receives the results
from the proposed initial cluster study, which may be required to bid into a resource
solicitation.1233 Cypress Creek contends that it is impractical to include the proposed
demonstration requirements at early stages in the interconnection study process and that
this construct is not workable in markets where merchant sales are common.
Enel, NextEra, and Public Interest Organizations argue that precluding entry into
the interconnection queue due to lack of a demonstration of commercial readiness would
be an anticompetitive measure favoring entities, such as incumbent transmission
providers, that could favor their own proposed generating facilities ahead of others
because of their enhanced ability to demonstrate their proposed generating facilities as
commercially ready.1234 For instance, CREA and NewSun assert that, unlike independent
power producers, an incumbent, vertically integrated utility can easily meet the second
prong of the readiness criteria to enter the interconnection queue and proceed to the
facilities study by simply identifying its preferred resource in its own resource plan,
selecting it as the winning bid in its own utility-run RFP, or just attesting that the utility is
“developing” the generating facility.1235

CREA and NewSun claim that the commercial readiness proposal would drive
most, if not all, independent power producers from the market, which would raise costs to
consumers by eliminating competition and innovation.1236 SEIA asserts that by
proposing a commercial readiness demonstration framework that is nearly impossible for
independent power producers to meet, the Commission is incorrectly implying that
generating facilities developed by independent power producers are inherently not
commercially viable.1237 SEIA emphasizes that independent power producers play a
critical role in bringing robust competition to markets by driving innovation and
decreasing the cost of providing power.1238
Alliant Energy claims that requiring demonstration of commercial readiness prior
to an interconnection customer entering the interconnection queue may do more harm
than good.1239 Alliant Energy argues that the commercial viability of a proposed
generating facility depends heavily on the costs of network upgrades and interconnection
facilities required to accommodate a generating facility’s interconnection, which cannot
be known prior to a generating facility receiving cost estimates that are dependable and
enable interconnection customers to make decisions during the interconnection process.

Vistra argues that the proposed increase in study deposits, withdrawal penalties,
and exclusive site control requirements will significantly reduce the number of
speculative interconnection requests entering the interconnection queue, making the
commercial readiness proposal redundant.1240 Vistra notes that the Commission has
relied on fact-specific showings to accept requirements to demonstrate commercial
readiness thus far, and Vistra argues that the fact that the Commission has accepted a
transmission provider’s revised LGIP under FPA section 205 does not establish that the
pro forma LGIP is unjust and unreasonable without the commercial readiness
proposal.1241
Vistra states that, beyond simple timing concerns, procurement decisions and
eligibility to enter the interconnection queue are interrelated in a way that creates a
chicken-and-egg problem.1242 Vistra explains that it is difficult for a generating facility to
be shortlisted for procurement without line of sight to obtaining a signed interconnection
agreement because the signed interconnection agreement brings more certainty to the
generating facility’s commercial operation date. Vistra expresses concern that the
Commission’s proposal to require an executed term sheet to enter the interconnection
queue and an executed contract to enter the facilities study process will simply shift the
burden of this chicken-and-egg problem to the procurement process. Vistra asserts that

the status quo appropriately balances the inherent difficulty of coordinating procurement
and interconnection.
Invenergy argues that the proposed requirements are inappropriate and should not
be applied nationally because they are based on a small subset of transmission providers
that have adopted “readiness” requirements with little evidence that they are effective,
given the continuing interconnection queue reform efforts in some of those same
regions.1243 Invenergy adds that, if additional assurance of an interconnection customer’s
intent to pursue its interconnection request is needed, the Commission should consider a
requirement to post a certain amount of security that becomes increasingly at risk to
move through the interconnection queue, as is done in some RTO/ISO regions.
NextEra asserts that generating facilities may be fully viable based on criteria that
are different from what the NOPR proposes. For example, NextEra states that it is
possible that storage or other types of generating facilities entering the market will not
require power purchase agreements or designation as network resources to be
commercially viable.1244
R Street argues that a key to efficient generating facility development is to enable
parallel work flows.1245 R Street claims that, by imposing extensive prerequisites to
advance in the interconnection process, commercial readiness requirements would

introduce greater process dependencies in generating facility development. R Street adds
that granting non-RTO/ISO transmission providers discretion over commercial readiness
requirements could lead to discriminatory behavior (e.g., non-RTO/ISO transmission
providers withholding off-take contracts to discriminate against other potential suppliers).
MISO states that it is concerned about the utility and impacts of the proposed
commercial readiness framework.1246 MISO explains that interconnection customers
with commitments from off-takers can be commercially unready and often cause the
greatest interconnection queue disruption by lingering the longest in the queue. As an
example, MISO posits a proposed generating facility that would be commercially viable
provided it does not incur network upgrade costs in excess of $5 million dollars. MISO
argues that such a generating facility is likely to remain in the interconnection queue
despite not having a viable business case, in the hopes that other interconnection
customers will withdraw their requests and costs will decrease. MISO asserts that, to
indicate commercial readiness, a term sheet or contract would need to show not only that
there was an off-taker but also that the projected income for the proposed generating
facility is sufficient to render the generating facility commercially viable, given estimated
study and network upgrade costs, which would be exceedingly difficult to require from
interconnection customers and nearly impossible for a transmission provider to evaluate
and verify.

Anbaric claims that the proposed core readiness requirements do not align with the
development trajectory of planned transmission projects for offshore wind generation.1247
NextEra asserts that commercial readiness requirements at the interconnection
request stage are inappropriate.1248 NextEra explains that interconnection customers do
not have a simple test for distinguishing speculative interconnection requests from other
interconnection requests. Rather, NextEra continues, successful generating facility
development depends on whether the interconnection customer concludes that the
interconnection arrangement is acceptable and whether the generating facility’s location
and costs are agreeable to its customers.
NextEra also argues that meeting any readiness milestones after the submission of
an interconnection request (e.g., when entering the facilities study phase) should be
premised on the interconnection customer having received timely and accurate study
results, including from affected systems.1249 NextEra asserts that it is not just and
reasonable to impose increasingly strict requirements on interconnection customers
without devising means of accelerating interconnection queue processing by transmission
providers and ensuring transmission providers comply with their tariffs.
Longroad recommends that the Commission clearly tie the interconnection
customer’s commitment to pay for network upgrades to a security deposit applied toward

the costs thereof during the cluster study phases, and that the security deposits for
network upgrades progressively increase at each stage of the cluster study process.1250
Longroad asserts that in the initial cluster study, the security deposit should be a modest
percentage of the allocated network upgrade cost and increase to, for example, 25% of
the network upgrade cost allocation to enter the facilities study. Longroad contends that
the interconnection customer should have the option to either fully fund the network
upgrade as a milestone in the LGIA or to fund in advance the transmission provider’s
estimated quarterly spending towards engineering, procurement, and construction of the
network upgrades.

Proposed Readiness Demonstrations

Commenters raise significant issues with the readiness demonstration options
proposed in the NOPR. With respect to the first proposed readiness demonstration
option,1251 commenters argue that providing power purchase agreements or term sheets
will be unworkable for most interconnection customers, particularly merchant
developers, because: (1) developers do not have sufficient information about
interconnection costs to move forward with a term sheet or power purchase agreement at

Executed term sheet (or comparable evidence) related to a contract for sale of
(1) the constructed generating facility to a load-serving entity or to a commercial,
industrial, or other large end-use customer, (2) the generating facility’s energy or capacity
where the term of sale is not less than five (5) years, or (3) the generating facility’s
ancillary services where the term of sale is not less than five (5) years.

the time they enter into the interconnection study process; and (2) the proposals to make
more information available to interconnection customers prior to submitting an
interconnection request will not provide sufficiently granular or certain information to
overcome this barrier.1252
Commenters further note that the vast majority of power purchasers seek
generating facilities with advanced interconnection queue positions (with preference for a
finalized LGIA or SGIA) before signing a power purchase agreement or finalizing a state
procurement.1253 CREA and NewSun, as well as SEIA, argue that a contract for
provision of ancillary services, is almost entirely foreclosed to many non-synchronous
generating facilities because nearly every transmission provider bars non-synchronous
generating facilities from providing ancillary services, either explicitly or through
operating requirements.1254

Commenters also assert that, if independent power producers are forced to enter
into contracts before costs are certain, then they would need to incorporate that
uncertainty into the power purchase agreement offer, which would drive up the costs of
these contracts, resulting in higher consumer costs.1255 Commenters contend that, if the
independent power producer does not reflect the costs of the network upgrades in its
power purchase agreement price, either the independent power producer or the consumer
may attempt to break the contract, which would lead to increased contractual
litigation.1256 Vistra adds that the purchaser will then need to start the procurement
process over or choose to over-procure as insurance against potential contract
termination, to the detriment of reliability and cost.1257
SoCal Edison argues that, in some regions, an executed contract option for
entering the facilities study could unintentionally encourage LSEs to sign contracts with
developers for more energy or capacity than they need to secure resources to meet their
procurement targets.1258 SoCal Edison contends that competition in certain areas for
particular generation resources may be high, which may force other LSEs to prematurely

enter into contracts with developers to secure generation without the benefit of the
facilities study, which is currently relied on by LSEs to assess commercial viability of a
generating facility before contracts are signed. AEE asserts that customers may
ultimately bear the cost of the selection of generating facilities that may not be the least
cost options in the market but are able to execute a term sheet or power purchase
agreement regardless of the ultimate level of interconnection costs.1259
Commenters also assert that it is unreasonable to expect that a buyer and seller
will be able to finalize negotiation of a contract between the time of the cluster restudy
(or amendment of the restudy if additional interconnection customers withdraw upon
receipt of the restudy results) and the time the facilities study agreement must be
executed.1260
CAISO requests that the Commission describe in detail what would constitute a
term sheet.1261 CAISO states that in its experience with similar tariff provisions,
interconnection customers frequently try to submit questionable or even misleading
documentation to meet the tariff requirements.
Invenergy argues that, to the extent an off-take agreement or term sheet remains an
option to demonstrate readiness, the Commission should clarify that transmission

providers are not entitled or even permitted to review the commercial terms of the term
sheet or agreement, which may be confidential and is not subject to the transmission
provider’s discretion.1262
GSCE does not dispute that readiness requirements are important but argues that
basing them on contracting status is misguided for the following reasons: (1) it does not
focus on early-stage developmental steps that drive generating facility viability and
indicate true commercial readiness; (2) it provides incentives for interconnection
customers that have not taken concrete steps toward readiness to bid low in competitive
solicitations, creating fictional “contracted” capacity that may never prove viable; (3) the
contracting landscape is evolving, and long-term contracting is no longer required for
successful project financing or the emerging realities of capital markets, and with the
inflationary environment, long-term contracts may currently be harder to finance than
short-term contracts; and (4) a focus on contracting to enter the interconnection study
process forces commercial negotiations to occur before generating facilities are studied
and have sufficient cost certainty or development timeline assurances.1263
Commenters also point to significant issues with the second proposed readiness
demonstration option.1264 They argue that requiring evidence that a proposed generating

facility is “selected in a resource plan or resource solicitation plan by or for [an LSE], is
being developed by [an LSE], or is being developed for purposes of a sale to a
commercial, industrial, or other a large end-use customer” is discriminatory and
preferential without cause or reasonable support.1265
Several commenters argue that the option for interconnection customers to
demonstrate commercial readiness by showing that the generating facility is being
developed for purposes of a sale to an end-use customer suffers a timing challenge
because it is nearly impossible for the independent power producer to price a sales
contract to a retail customer, or the customer having much interest in discussing the
transaction, without having reasonable certainty as to the generating facility’s likely
interconnection costs.1266
SoCal Edison recommends that the Commission clarify or give additional
examples of reasonable evidence that a proposed generating facility has been selected in
an LSE’s resource solicitation process or allow a transmission provider to determine how

this option can be met.1267 SoCal Edison states that evidence that a proposed generating
facility has been short-listed in an LSE request for offer should be considered reasonable
evidence for moving into the facilities study.
Several commenters argue that the third readiness demonstration option, a
provisional LGIA,1268 is likely unworkable as well because it would require independent
power producers to assume almost all the risk of the network upgrade costs without
knowing those costs.1269 On the other hand, CAISO asserts that interconnection
customers could escape financial consequences and bypass the NOPR’s requirements
through the provisional LGIA option.1270 CAISO argues that, at a minimum, the
Commission should allow transmission providers to provide the provisional LGIA option
where they believe it will work, but not require all transmission providers to enable
interconnection customers to bypass commercial readiness through provisional LGIAs.
SoCal Edison and CAISO recommend that the Commission provide additional
guidance on, or more clearly define, the term “provisional LGIA.”1271 CAISO also states

that it is unclear how interconnection customers that have yet to be studied could submit
provisional LGIAs because LGIAs describe the network upgrades and facilities from
interconnection studies.1272 CAISO states that interconnection customers are likely to
request provisional LGIAs because demonstrating commercial readiness in RTOs/ISOs is
generally impossible until after studies are complete.
Commenters claim that the record does not support adopting the proposed
commercial readiness framework within RTOs/ISOs, arguing that it would be
unreasonable and unduly discriminatory.1273 These commenters argue that the record in
RTOs/ISOs does not support the NOPR’s assertion that generating facilities are generally
not constructed without some form of off-take agreement. They assert that the
commercial readiness criteria should not be required at all in RTO/ISO regions (with
locational marginal price-based markets), where generating facilities can move forward
in many cases without a specific off-taker. Some commenters also argue that an
RTO/ISO should not have to evaluate contracts for the sale of a generating facility’s
output or determine whether the generating facility has been selected in a resource plan or
resource solicitation process in any of the potentially multiple states within its
footprint.1274

Commenters argue that the proposed 10-business day cure period to resolve
potential commercial readiness deficiencies is insufficient given the complicated business
and technical decisions involved.1275 Invenergy states the interconnection process often
extends for several years and it is entirely possible that commercial arrangements may
change during that time.1276 Invenergy states that these changes may require additional
negotiations, but should not call into question the customer’s commitment to developing
its project and risk being withdrawn from the interconnection queue. Ørsted requests a
30-business day cure period instead.1277

Alternative Commercial Readiness
Demonstrations

Some commenters argue that the Commission should consider expanding this list

completion of environmental, local, state, or federal permitting processes.1278 CREA and
NewSun, as well as Northwest and Intermountain, ask the Commission to provide QFs a
more relaxed readiness option than a fully executed power purchase agreement,

especially when a transmission provider requires qualifying facilities to have a completed
interconnection study result to obtain a draft power purchase agreement under its state
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) implementation programs (e.g.,
PacifiCorp).1279 CREA and NewSun suggest that the Commission could allow QFs to
submit an affidavit from the interconnection customer, stating that the avoided cost rates
offered are sufficient to finance and bring the QF into commercial operation if
interconnection can be obtained.1280 CREA and NewSun contend that this option is
consistent with the Commission’s obligation to adopt regulations that encourage
development of QFs.
Comments are mixed on the potential additional demonstrations of commercial
readiness on which the Commission requested comment in the NOPR. Several
commenters support the three potential other readiness options suggested in the NOPR,
or a combination thereof.1281

several commenters argue that the proposal would be essentially meaningless because
practically all interconnection requests would qualify.1282
As for the second and third potential alternative demonstration options—a site
specific purchase order for generating equipment specific to the interconnection request,
or a statement signed by an officer or authorized agent of the interconnection customer
attesting that the generating facility is to be supplied with major electric generating
components (such as wind turbines) with a manufacturer’s blanket purchase agreement to
which the interconnection customer is a party—PacifiCorp and Ameren oppose these
options.1283 PacifiCorp argues that, although it originally adopted a similar provision in
its initial interconnection queue reform process, in the course of administering its first
two cluster studies, it determined that this readiness option set a low hurdle that
speculative interconnection requests could easily overcome.1284 Similarly, SPP does not
support site-specific purchase orders or statements attesting to supply of major
components as evidence of commercial readiness.1285 Enel asserts that it is inappropriate
to require procurement of major power equipment prior to an interconnection request or,
in many cases, even before executing an LGIA.1286 Enel contends that requiring

procurement of specific generating equipment prior to applying for interconnection is
detrimental to reliability because newer technologies procured after the execution of an
LGIA often have advanced features that did not exist a few years earlier. Enel explains
that it procures major wind, solar, and battery generation equipment between 12 and 24
months prior to energizing a new generating facility to the transmission system, typically
after execution of an LGIA and a full investment review (including knowledge of
interconnection costs and schedules) are complete. Enel adds that a generating facility
without interconnection results carries too much risk for interconnection customers and
investors to risk significant financial deposits to reserve site specific generation
equipment. Similarly, Xcel states that interconnection customers want the flexibility to
wait until the last minute to order equipment and start construction, which results in
different equipment being ordered than initially expected.1287
Some commenters argue that the proposed commercial readiness requirements
unduly discriminate against pumped storage projects, which often do not have the
commercial pathways and timelines associated with other types of generating
facilities.1288 Those commenters explain that the development of a pumped storage
project is an iterative process of assessment and de-risking that takes several years to
complete, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. They suggest that achieving one of the

following three criteria would be sufficient evidence of commercial readiness for a
pumped storage project: (1) a filing of notice of intent to apply for an original license
and pre-application document with the Commission; (2) an executed memorandum of
understanding, letter of intent, or an equivalent term sheet with a utility; or (3) selection
of the project in an integrated resource plan (IRP) process. They add that, in lieu of
having achieved one of these, a commercial readiness deposit of $2,000 per MW is
appropriate. These commenters ask the Commission to add the receipt of a Commission
license to the list of milestone developments in section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP.
Commenters recommend several alternative bases to determine commercial
readiness, including: (1) a 50% generator tie line site control requirement;1289 (2) a
project development plan to determine readiness;1290 (3) documentation of developer due
diligence, including available transmission capacity and modeling;1291 (4) participating in
and meeting the eligibility requirements for a state-mandated procurement program;1292
and (5) an executed firm point-to-point transmission service agreement from the
proposed point of interconnection to a point of consumption for the generating facility’s

To address the Commission’s concerns while maintaining the commercial viability
of planned transmission projects for offshore wind, Anbaric asks the Commission to
consider requiring such projects to make the following demonstrations to satisfy the
commercial readiness requirements: (1) site control of property near the point of
interconnection suitable for a converter station of a specified size (expressed in MWs)
needed to enable high voltage direct current (HVDC) lines carrying offshore wind energy
to be put onto the regional transmission system; (2) site control of a property at a
coastline location suitable for the transition from seabed to terrestrial routes sufficient to
move the specified amount of MWs identified in interconnection requests; and (3) a state
procurement policy or goal to procure a defined amount of offshore wind generation
associated with a planned transmission project within a defined time frame.1294
Eversource supports the Commission’s proposed commercial readiness framework
but asks the Commission to strengthen it by requiring the interconnection customer to
demonstrate project financing (along with the current proposed requirements).1295
Eversource also asks the Commission to require interconnection customers to provide a
preliminary project schedule that identifies all key milestones and timelines.
Fervo Energy argues that, for cluster study and restudy processes, the proposed
framework should allow the interconnection customer to demonstrate readiness by using
a combination of options, such as executed term sheets for a portion of the facility plus

deposits on a $/MW basis calculated from the quotient of the study deposit amount and
the proposed generating facility size.1296
ENGIE and SEIA ask the Commission to make the commercial readiness
demonstration a requirement for entering into an LGIA.1297 ENGIE and SEIA assert that
a later-stage commercial readiness demonstration will allow independent power
producers to make rational business decisions based on reasonably certain network
upgrade costs.

Deposit in Lieu of Readiness

Some commenters contend that the proposal to allow interconnection customers to
provide a deposit in lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness does not cure the
potential for undue discrimination that results from retaining commercial readiness
options that are easily attained by incumbent, vertically integrated utilities but infeasible
for independent power producers.1298 These commenters claim that, because it is nearly
impossible for an independent power producer to make any of the commercial readiness
demonstrations currently proposed, the deposit in lieu of meeting the commercial
readiness requirements would not be an “option” for independent power producers but
rather would be the only path forward in the interconnection process.

Some commenters support the deposit in lieu of readiness option, as proposed.
For instance, SoCal Edison asserts that an increased financial requirement via a deposit in
lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness should help to identify those interconnection
requests that are economically viable and to which the transmission provider should focus
its resources.1299 Northwest and Intermountain state that providing interconnection
customers with an option to demonstrate commercial readiness through a deposit is
essential to ensuring a competitive market for generation by providing a way for
independent power producers to enter the interconnection queue.1300 MISO supports the
concept of commercial readiness deposits, with the first one due at the time of submission
of an interconnection request, which would then be forfeited if the interconnection
request does not result in an LGIA, and a second, higher deposit due at the time of
execution of an LGIA, to be refunded upon a generating facility achieving commercial
operation.1301 MISO also supports the Commission’s proposal to make these deposits
separate from, and in addition to, study deposits, as well as MISO’s existing milestone
requirements in its interconnection study process. MISO believes that these proposals
could be a useful deterrent to speculative or unviable interconnection requests entering
into or lingering in MISO’s interconnection queue.

MISO TOs argue that, in keeping with the overall theme of flexibility and respect
for regional differences, the Commission should afford transmission providers flexibility
to adopt readiness requirements and deposit amounts that are appropriate for their
regions.1302 MISO suggests deposits could consist of two components: (1) a minimum
amount per interconnection request, regardless of proposed service levels, and (2) a per
MW amount.1303 MISO asks that the commercial readiness deposit increase the pool of
money available to offset cost shifts, and any additional monies be utilized to defray the
study costs of interconnection customers that actually reach commercial operation.
Some commenters argue that allowing deposits and security to be posted in lieu of
demonstrating commercial readiness may not be sufficient to accomplish the NOPR’s
goals,1304 and may, in fact, hinder the NOPR’s goals.1305 APPA-LPPC assert that the
financial commitments proposed in the NOPR, while not insignificant, do not reflect the
potentially substantial cost of continuing to tolerate the ongoing uncertainty.1306 APS

may not be commercially viable.1307 Tri-State asserts that the fact that all 53 applicants in
its 2022 interconnection queue elected to provide additional financial security at phase 1
in its study process, instead of one of three readiness milestones, demonstrates that
deposits are not effective at deterring unready interconnection requests from entering the
interconnection queue.1308
Other commenters recommend changes to the Commission’s proposal. For
instance, North Dakota Commission recommends either removing the deposits in lieu of
demonstrating readiness or increasing readiness deposit amounts to an amount that
provides a quantifiable, evidence-based reduction in speculative interconnection
requests.1309
PacifiCorp states that its interconnection process also allows an interconnection
customer to make a payment of $3,000/MW in lieu of meeting commercial readiness
demonstration requirements.1310 PacifiCorp expresses concern that the NOPR proposal
would reduce the payment obligation (in comparison to what is required today under
PacifiCorp’s LGIP), thus lowering the bar for more speculative interconnection requests
to enter the interconnection queue and increasing risks for further study delays.

CAISO contends that the Commission’s proposed deposit requirements are low,
such that any modern interconnection customer could meet them.1311 CAISO questions
whether the deposit requirements (or any deposit requirements) would deter
uncompetitive interconnection requests or reduce interconnection queue sizes. CAISO
argues that using arbitrary figures to set deposit requirements is unlikely to yield
meaningful results. CAISO urges the Commission to gather more data or hold a
technical conference to develop meaningful deposit amounts, based on data provided by
transmission providers.
EEI and NRECA suggest further reducing potential risks of speculative
interconnection requests by making deposits non-refundable.1312 NRECA argues that the
deposit in lieu of readiness should only be refunded when the interconnection customer
has provided an appropriate commercial readiness demonstration or achieves commercial
operation, adding that allowing any other refund of this deposit dilutes the effectiveness
of this readiness requirement.1313 EEI and NYTOs assert that a deposit in lieu of
readiness should only be allowed in limited circumstances.1314

and instead to adopt an increasingly “at-risk” readiness deposit framework, similar to
what has been accepted in various RTOs/ISOs.1315 They contend that more directly
associating readiness deposits to the estimated costs and likely impact to other
interconnection customers if an interconnection customer withdraws would provide
greater accountability for interconnection customers and transmission providers.1316
PJM and Omaha Public Power assert that the Commission should consider basing
the readiness deposit amount on an average cost of network upgrades in the region
determined during previous studies, as this method would be based on a less arbitrary
valuation than as proposed.1317 SEIA urges the Commission to set the value of the
deposit amount as a percentage of the estimated network upgrade costs, which should be
capped at $2 million.1318 rPlus recommends a commercial readiness deposit of
$2,000/MW, noting that this figure is common in industry practice.1319

Some commenters contend that the level of the proposed readiness deposits is too
high and should be significantly revised.1320 Pattern Energy requests that the
Commission clarify if these deposits are additive or whether they would require an
interconnection customer to have available seven times the study deposit amount by the
time the interconnection request reaches the facilities study phase. Pattern Energy states
that if the payments are additive, then the Commission would be requiring an
interconnection customer to have 14 times its initial study deposit on hand by the time the
interconnection customer reaches the LGIA milestone, which Pattern Energy contends
would be unreasonable.1321
Invenergy argues that depositing as much as $3.5 million before learning how
much must be spent on network upgrades is not reasonable.1322 ACE-NY argues that the
deposit values for the second cluster and beyond should be limited to just two times the
study deposit amount.1323 CREA and NewSun contend that the hefty deposits will bar
smaller companies with less access to capital from competing and entering the

the interconnection process rather than measurably improving the process.
National Grid requests clarification that transmission providers may deduct from a
to-be-returned deposit any expenses incurred by the transmission provider in
administering the respective escrow account.1325
Pattern Energy contends that the Commission must clarify that deposits will be
applied toward future security obligations if a generating facility reduces its size as it
progresses through the interconnection process.1326 Pattern Energy states that if the size
of an interconnection request is reduced, in accordance with allowable reduction
amounts, then: (1) future deposits should be based on the new generating facility size;
and (2) previous deposits should be credited toward future deposits based on the portion
of those previous deposits that are associated with the reduced MW quantity.

These commenters argue that such measures need to be carefully balanced to avoid
overly burdening interconnection customers with legitimate interconnection requests that
are delayed for reasons out of their control. For example, NY Commission and
NYSERDA explain that, in New York, renewable energy certificates procured by
NYSERDA could demonstrate commercial readiness, and a similar state agency
certificate could be used in a different state.1328
Pacific Northwest Utilities claim that it would be difficult for transmission
providers to implement the commercial readiness proposal in regions such as the
Northwest without reforming RFP processes and coordinating amongst multiple
transmission owners and LSEs.1329 Pacific Northwest Utilities explain that many
generating facilities in the Pacific Northwest use interconnection and transmission
services crossing multiple balancing authority areas, which require coordination of
timelines, milestones, and off-ramps in both the RFPs and interconnection queues.

pro forma LGIP section 11.3 by suspending its LGIA.1330 However, Enel notes that it is
important for the Commission to retain (and reinstitute where removed by specific
transmission providers) the ability for interconnection customers to suspend work under
their LGIAs for up to three years.
Arizona Commission generally supports the prioritization of commercially ready
projects and agrees with the proposed readiness criteria, but also encourages the
Commission to consider the possibility of allowing market forces to provide discipline to
the interconnection process, such as by allowing transmission owners to prioritize
generation projects through the use of competitive solicitations.1331
The Colorado Commission generally supports prioritizing commercially ready
interconnection requests and agrees with the proposed readiness criteria.1332 However,
the Colorado Commission emphasizes that the NOPR does not include a mechanism to
prioritize among the many viable, and competing, interconnection requests when

under existing RTO/ISO interconnection processes as well as the proposed revised pro

generating facility’s broader attributes from a system perspective, including cost, timing,

location, and resource type.1334 The Colorado Commission asserts that new proposed
generating facilities would likely be stuck in cluster studies with no clear or timely
prioritization that ensures that the lowest cost or highest value generating facilities come
online quickly and at a reasonable cost. The Colorado Commission contends that
prioritizing native load and end-use customers and third-party owned generating facilities
through competitive bid processes is the most logical criteria to maintain a reliable
system at reasonable cost.1335 To accomplish this, and help the system rationally move
forward in a timely manner, the Colorado Commission suggests adding the following
additional language to the commercial readiness section: “RTOs and Transmission
Providers shall have the ability to create a separate cluster study process or other
mechanisms to prioritize executed contracts that serve and benefit native load in
accordance with local load-serving resources needs and priorities as determined through
equitable competitive bid processes.”1336
AEE, on the other hand, responds to the Colorado Commission by arguing that
allowing transmission providers to prioritize generating facilities that are selected through
IRP processes or utility procurements and that benefit native load could allow vertically

process and therefore comes with a risk of discrimination.1337
CESA argues that proposals to prioritize and favor certain generating facilities and
interconnection customers must be rejected as violating the Commission’s long-standing
policies on open access and non-discriminatory interconnection procedures.1338 CESA
contends that the Colorado Commission’s proposal is therefore unduly discriminatory
and also goes well beyond what the Commission contemplated in the NOPR.
Clean Energy Associations state that they support the Commission’s instead
accepting regionally specific proposals that would align the interconnection process with
competitive procurements associated with resource planning, rather than placing them at
odds.1339 Clean Energy Associations state that projects selected though competitive
procurement processes are ready projects, and these processes attempt to consider the
transmission (interconnection service and transmission service) costs and the productionrelated costs. Clean Energy Associations state that one way to accomplish this might be
to grant resource solicitation clusters a queue position distinct from other clustered
projects, but that concept could be extended to ensure more certainty to the bidder and the
resource planning entity of the interconnection and delivery requirements and associated
rights.

Bonneville sees value in applying commercial readiness requirements to the pro

for interconnection customers to break up large projects into smaller projects to avoid
stringent commercial readiness requirements under the pro forma LGIP.1340

Commission Determination

We adopt a modified NOPR proposal to revise sections 3.4.2, 7.5, 8.1, and 11.3 of
the pro forma LGIP, insofar as they require interconnection customers to submit
commercial readiness deposits, and we do not adopt the NOPR proposal insofar as it
included non-financial commercial readiness demonstrations in the pro forma LGIP. To
effectuate the requirements that we adopt in this final rule, we modify the proposed
revisions to sections 3.4.2, 7.5, and 8.1 to remove the proposed readiness demonstrations
and to require that the interconnection customer submit the commercial readiness deposit
at the beginning of each study in the cluster study process (i.e., the initial cluster study,
the cluster restudy, and the facilities study). For the commercial readiness deposit
submitted to enter the cluster restudy and the commercial readiness deposit to enter the
facilities study, we also modify the NOPR proposal to move from commercial readiness
deposits based on study deposit amounts to commercial readiness deposits based on
percentages of the interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade costs. We also
modify proposed section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP to remove the language providing
that one of the proposed readiness demonstrations can be provided when the

interconnection customer returns the executed LGIA or requests that the LGIA be filed
unexecuted. We also adopt the definition of commercial readiness deposit but do not
adopt the definition of commercial readiness demonstration. We discuss each in turn.
We believe that, along with the other reforms adopted in this final rule, the
commercial readiness deposits we require will address the need for reform underlying
this Section by helping reduce the submission of speculative, commercially non-viable
interconnection requests into interconnection queues.1341 Further, because the
interconnection customer’s total commercial readiness deposit held by the transmission
provider increases as the interconnection process proceeds, we find that this approach
will encourage interconnection customers not ready to proceed through the
interconnection process—or whose projects become commercially non-viable during the
interconnection process—to withdraw earlier in the process, thereby lessening the
incidence of late-stage withdrawals that result in delays and restudies. Similarly, by
basing the cluster restudy and the facilities study commercial readiness deposits on the
interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade cost assignment, an
interconnection customer will be subject to the cost consequences of its estimated
network upgrades earlier. As a result, this approach will encourage interconnection
customers to withdraw earlier in the interconnection process if they face large network
upgrade initial cost assignments or encounter other concerns that cause their

interconnection request to be uneconomic. By reducing the number of speculative
interconnection requests submitted into the interconnection queue and the number of latestage withdrawals of interconnection requests, we believe that the commercial readiness
deposit requirements that we adopt herein will also enable commercially viable
interconnection requests to progress more quickly through the interconnection process.
Transmission providers will be able to focus their resources on those interconnection
requests most likely to achieve commercial operation, to the benefit of all interconnection
customers.1342
The commercial readiness deposit amounts proposed in the NOPR are tied to
generating facility size, as they are based on the initial study deposit, which is likewise
tied to generating facility size. We adopt the NOPR proposal for the initial commercial
readiness deposit, where the interconnection customer pays a deposit of two times the
study deposit to enter the cluster study. Basing the initial commercial readiness deposit
on the size of the generating facility aligns the size of the deposit roughly with any
impact from a withdrawal of the interconnection request, as generally, all else equal,

increasing the size of the generating facility increases the likelihood of larger, more
costly network upgrades and a greater change in interconnection study inputs.
However, we are persuaded by several commenters that commercial readiness
deposits should be based on assigned network upgrade costs.1343 Therefore, we modify
the remaining commercial readiness deposits (i.e., the second and third commercial
readiness deposits) such that, rather than relying on multiples of the initial study deposit,
once estimates of network upgrade costs are available, the commercial readiness deposits
equate to increasing percentages of the interconnection customer’s identified network
upgrade cost assignment. Specifically, we adopt a deposit structure where the
commercial readiness deposit to enter the cluster restudy is the amount required to bring
the total amount of the interconnection customer’s commercial readiness deposit to 5% of
the interconnection customer’s network upgrade cost assignment identified in the cluster
study, and the commercial readiness deposit to enter the facilities study is the amount
required to bring the total amount of the interconnection customer’s commercial
readiness deposit to 10% of the interconnection customer’s network upgrade cost
assignment identified in the cluster study or restudy, as applicable.1344 We find that tying

the commercial readiness deposits to the network upgrade cost estimate requires the
interconnection customer to deposit an amount that corresponds to its network upgrade
cost estimates earlier and, thereby, can incentivize interconnection customers with large
network upgrade cost estimates to withdraw at earlier points in the interconnection
process to the extent the network upgrade cost assignment causes the interconnection
request to no longer be viable. This approach achieves the Commission’s goals of
ensuring that interconnection customers are able to interconnect in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner.
We decline to adopt the non-financial commercial readiness demonstrations
proposed in the NOPR. We find that the non-financial commercial readiness
demonstrations are not necessary to address the subject of these reforms—providing
additional deterrence of speculative, commercially non-viable interconnection requests—
given the significant, increasing commercial readiness deposits we adopt instead.1345
We are also persuaded by commenters who express concerns that the nonfinancial commercial readiness demonstrations in the NOPR proposal may not
necessarily serve as appropriate indicators of a proposed generating facility’s commercial
viability on a national basis. In some instances, the proposed non-financial commercial

readiness demonstrations may be unavailable to interconnection customers with
commercially viable projects. For example, this may be true as a result of a
misalignment of the timing between resource procurement decisions and interconnection
study processes or inconsistency with a relevant local commercial practice, rather than
because the proposed generating facilities lack commercial viability.
As commenters note, resource procurement efforts across the country all have
different timelines, and the timeline to demonstrate commercial readiness proposed in the
NOPR was not tailored to meet the timelines of multiple state procurement efforts.1346 As
commenters explain, an interconnection queue position is often a precondition of offering
into a resource solicitation.1347 We agree that, absent a regionally tailored tariff process
pursuant to which commercial readiness criteria could be aligned with applicable
resource solicitation processes, the commercial readiness criteria proposed in the NOPR
may not be workable in markets where merchant sales are common, and this generally
applicable final rule is not an appropriate forum to dictate regionally tailored solutions.
We are further concerned that there may be trade-offs entailed in requiring the
proposed non-financial commercial readiness demonstrations, which are more
appropriately assessed on a regional, rather than national basis. We agree with Enel that
ratepayers may benefit from generating facilities being selected in competitive processes

that consider the facilities’ interconnection costs and schedule, which cannot be done if
off-take arrangements are made prior to applying for interconnection service.
In addition, we are concerned that the proposed non-financial commercial
readiness demonstrations could incentivize power purchasers in some regions to execute
purchase contracts with interconnection customers whose generating facilities will later
be determined to be commercially non-viable. As commenters note, this could lead to
purchasers having to start the procurement process over or choose to over-procure as
insurance against potential contract termination, to the detriment of reliability and cost.
Therefore, we are persuaded to adopt a framework that requires a commercial
readiness deposit for all interconnection customers, similar to what the Commission has
accepted in various RTO/ISO regions.1348 We find that requiring deposits in amounts
substantial enough to demonstrate commitment to reaching commercial operation at
progressive milestones throughout the interconnection process will be a sufficient
deterrent to speculative behavior—especially when considered as part of the
comprehensive package of reform, including increased site control requirements,
increased study deposits, and withdrawal penalties, established by this final rule.
In the NOPR, the Commission acknowledged the potential that certain nonfinancial commercial readiness demonstrations could provide an unduly discriminatory or
preferential advantage to projects being developed by transmission providers or their

affiliates.1349 As summarized above, several commenters have raised—and elaborated
on—those concerns. Because we find that the commercial readiness deposits that we
adopt in this final rule are sufficient to address the relevant need for reform, and therefore
do not adopt the proposed non-financial commercial readiness demonstrations, we need
not further address those concerns in this final rule.
We recognize that the Commission has previously accepted proposals that include
commercial readiness demonstration requirements similar to those proposed in the
NOPR. Although we find that commercial readiness deposits are sufficient to address the
need for reform in this proceeding, this finding does not preclude transmission providers
from adopting non-financial commercial readiness demonstrations, provided they meet
the relevant standards when requesting a variation, as discussed above.
Some commenters suggest that the Commission could add government and
environmental permits as commercial readiness demonstrations as an indicator of
commercial readiness that is viable both for independent power producers and for
transmission providers and their affiliates.1350 Although the record provides some
support for this, we are concerned that permits and studies may expire due to the length
of the interconnection process, and those re-permitting and restudy efforts are still at risk

of rejection or failure, which could lead to late-stage withdrawals.1351 We are also
concerned about the possible administrative burden placed on transmission providers, as
they must determine which types of permits should be accepted as commercial readiness
demonstrations and evaluate the validity of different permits submitted by
interconnection customers.
Pattern Energy requests that the Commission clarify whether the commercial
readiness deposits are additive, meaning that, as each phase of the interconnection
process is reached, the full amount of each new readiness deposit must be added on top of
the full amounts of earlier readiness deposits (as opposed to merely increasing the total
amount of the aggregate readiness deposit to match the level specified for that phase). In
response, we clarify that, as modified, the commercial readiness deposits in sections 7.5
and 8.1 of the pro forma LGIP make clear that for the second and third commercial
readiness deposits, the interconnection customer is only required to submit an additional
deposit that brings the total commercial readiness deposit to the amount specified in
sections 7.5 and 8.1 of the pro forma LGIP (5% of the interconnection customer’s
identified network upgrade cost estimate and 10% of the interconnection customer’s
identified network upgrade cost estimate, respectively).
In response to comments on the magnitude of commercial readiness deposits (e.g.,
too high or too low), we reiterate that the commercial readiness deposits are part of a
package of reforms meant to deter speculative behavior that also includes site control

requirements and withdrawal penalties. Thus, the commercial readiness deposits are not
intended to be of such magnitude to alone prevent speculative behavior as they are
intended to work together with other reforms adopted in this final rule, such as site
control and withdrawal penalties. We believe that the deposits should not be so high that
viable projects from smaller developers are unable to enter the queue. At the same time,
they will only achieve the aims if they are sufficiently high to serve as some deterrent, in
concert with the other relevant reforms adopted in this final rule. In response to National
Grid’s request that the final rule provide for the deduction from a to-be-returned deposit
of any expenses incurred by the transmission provider or RTO/ISO in administering the
respective escrow account, we note that Order No. 2003 required the collection of various
deposits without addressing this type of administrative expense.1352 We find, in this
instance, that there is no need to deviate from Order No. 2003, and we decline to adopt
tariff revisions to address the management of an escrow account.
In response to Pattern Energy’s request for clarification of the commercial
readiness deposit amounts in the event that an interconnection customer reduces the size
of a proposed generating facility, we clarify that because the modified commercial
readiness deposit structure is based on network upgrade cost estimates, a size reduction to
a proposed generating facility may or may not impact the remaining commercial
readiness deposits, depending on whether the size reduction reduces the interconnection
customer’s assigned network upgrade costs. This is consistent with the requirements for

entering the cluster restudy and facilities study adopted in pro forma LGIP sections 7.5
and 8.1, respectively, which require commercial readiness deposits based on percentages
of the interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade costs.
Pattern Energy’s request to require that previous deposits be credited towards
future deposits based on the portion of those previous deposits that are associated with
the reduced MW quantity therefore represents the modified commercial readiness deposit
framework we adopt. Under this modified framework, an interconnection customer’s
previous commercial readiness deposits are effectively credited when it pays later
commercial readiness deposits (i.e., the second and third commercial readiness deposits);
it pays the required amount of a commercial readiness deposit less the amounts paid for
through earlier commercial readiness deposits.
We also decline to adopt Bonneville’s suggestion to add the commercial readiness
provisions to the SGIP because the record does not demonstrate a need for such reform at
this time. Because we are not adopting the proposed non-financial commercial readiness
demonstrations, we do not address comments proposing revisions or clarifications to
those demonstrations. Additionally, several commenters provide additional suggestions
for the NOPR proposal, including: (1) addressing the Commission’s rules for suspending
an LGIA;1353 (2) addressing queue priority;1354 and (3) better supporting competitive

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require interconnection customers to
submit a deposit equal to nine times the amount of its study deposit when executing the
LGIA or requesting the filing of an unexecuted LGIA. The Commission explained that
this deposit would be fully refunded once the generating facility achieves commercial
operation, but if the interconnection customer withdraws after executing the LGIA or
after requesting the filing of an unexecuted LGIA, this deposit would be refunded subject
to the withdrawal penalty.1356 The Commission also sought comment on whether to
adopt additional provisions or a different framework that would require larger proposed
generating facilities to provide a higher deposit amount—such as a per MW
framework.1357

MISO believes it is necessary to continue the commercial readiness deposit and
withdrawal penalty framework until the interconnection request achieves commercial
operation.1358 Shell supports the security deposit obligations used in MISO’s and SPP’s
generator interconnection processes, which include a deposit at LGIA execution.1359
Invenergy argues that requiring more security at LGIA execution, in addition to
the other proposed burdens on interconnection customers in the NOPR, goes beyond the
goal of disincentivizing speculative interconnection requests to creating potentially
prohibitive burdens on all interconnection customers, including those with commercially
viable proposed generating facilities.1360 Invenergy contends that, while a deposit based
on study costs may make sense in earlier stages of the study process when assigned
network upgrade costs are not yet known, it is not appropriate after an LGIA is executed
and assigned network upgrade costs are known and memorialized. ACE-NY and AES
oppose any additional deposits due from an interconnection customer at the signing of the
LGIA that are not tied to network upgrade costs.1361 AES asserts that in many
RTOs/ISOs, interconnection customers have to post security for a portion, if not all, of
the assigned network upgrade costs associated with an interconnection request, and such

posted security is a sufficient incentive to keep an interconnection customer engaged so
that they will complete a generating facility after the LGIA is executed.1362
Several commenters argue that the Commission’s LGIA deposit proposal is
excessive and potentially exposes ratepayers to unjust and unreasonable costs.1363 Ørsted
would support a lower amount, such as two times the study deposit, because it believes
that the current proposal would not necessarily accurately estimate the costs of required
network upgrades.1364 PJM contends that the Commission should allow transmission
providers to adopt security amounts and structures that are rationally related to relevant
costs.1365 Cypress Creek asks the Commission to provide a non-arbitrary basis for its
proposed security deposit of nine times the study deposit.1366 Shell argues that the LGIA
deposit appears to be a security deposit and adds that MISO and SPP use a separate
security deposit obligation that the Commission should consider.1367

circumstances.1368 Invenergy argues that any deposit due at LGIA execution should be

subject to a $2 million cap and that deposit should be released dollar for dollar as the
interconnection customer posts security or makes required payments under the LGIA.1369
Invenergy asks that the Commission also clarify that, in the event a proposed generating
facility does not achieve commercial operation, any deposit forfeited under this proposal
offsets, and is not in addition to, any withdrawal penalties that may be imposed.
Invenergy adds that it is unreasonable to require that additional deposits be provided
when an interconnection customer asks that the LGIA be filed unexecuted, and if the
Commission does nonetheless require interconnection customers to post the deposit as a
condition of having the LGIA filed unexecuted, the deposit should be refundable if the
interconnection customer elects to withdraw within 30 days of the date of the
Commission’s order in the applicable docket. Ørsted and Shell assert that, for
interconnection customers withdrawing after executing the LGIA, all deposits should be
refunded in the event that the interconnection customer withdraws as a result of
circumstances outside of its control and the withdrawal does not harm any other
entity.1370 AES argues that all study deposits should be refunded at the time of LGIA
execution, and opposes any additional deposits not tied to network upgrade costs.1371

Southern, on the other hand, argues that making deposits refundable may not be
stringent enough and therefore may not accomplish the goals set forth in the NOPR.1372
NRECA also believes that the Commission should consider whether to make these study
deposits non-refundable in the case of withdrawal, as a further disincentive for
speculative interconnection requests to enter the interconnection queue.1373

We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal to revise new section 11.3 of the
pro forma LGIP to require interconnection customers to submit a deposit when executing
the LGIA, or requesting the filing of an unexecuted LGIA,and add the new term “LGIA
deposit” to section 1 of the pro forma LGIP.1374 Specifically, we modify the NOPR
proposal to require interconnection customers to provide a deposit that will increase the
total commercial readiness deposit paid to be equal to 20% of the estimated network
upgrade costs identified in the LGIA, rather than providing a deposit equal to nine times
the amount of the interconnection customer’s study deposit, as proposed in the NOPR.1375

At LGIA execution or at the time the request is made to file the unexecuted

Additionally, revised section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP requires that interconnection
customers submit the LGIA deposit when returning the executed LGIA to the
transmission provider, or within 10 business days of the interconnection customer
requesting that the LGIA be filed unexecuted at the Commission.
In the NOPR, the Commission sought comment on whether to adopt additional
provisions or a different framework for deposits, including the LGIA deposit.1376 In
response, commenters provided suggestions, including suggestions to base deposits on
network upgrade costs.1377 We agree that tying the LGIA deposit to the network upgrade
cost estimate sends a more accurate cost signal to the interconnection customer and better
aligns the LGIA deposit to its function of ensuring that network upgrades are paid for and
constructed than the NOPR proposal. We also agree with commenters that a deposit
based on the study deposit amount may make sense in the early stage of the cluster study
process when assigned network upgrade costs are not yet estimated, but later in the
process, when network upgrade cost estimates are available, the use of percentages of
network upgrade cost estimates more closely indicates interconnection request
viability.1378 This approach also addresses comments that the LGIA deposit, as proposed,
may have been arbitrary, excessive, and unreasonable.1379

The NOPR proposed that this deposit would be fully refunded once the generating
facility achieves commercial operation, but we are modifying the NOPR proposal to
remove that statement from pro forma LGIP section 11.3, and as explained further below,
this deposit will be used as part of the security the interconnection customer must provide
for the construction of network upgrades and transmission provider’s interconnection
facilities. However, this LGIA deposit could be refunded, subject to the withdrawal
penalty, if the interconnection customer withdraws after executing the LGIA or after
requesting the filing of an unexecuted LGIA.
We also revise the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA, as suggested by
Invenergy,1380 to treat the LGIA deposit as part of the security the interconnection
customer must provide for the construction of network upgrades and transmission
provider’s interconnection facilities. Article 11.5 (Provision of Security) of the pro
forma LGIA requires that, 30 calendar days prior to the commencement of construction
under its LGIA, the interconnection customer must provide security for a discrete portion
of network upgrades and transmission provider’s interconnection facilities, as specified in
its LGIA. We revise section 11.3 of the pro forma LGIP and article 11.5 of the pro
forma LGIA to require the transmission provider to use the LGIA deposit, in its entirety,
before requiring the interconnection customer to submit additional security for

construction of network upgrades and transmission provider’s interconnection facilities.
By allowing the transmission provider to draw down this LGIA deposit as construction
proceeds, the construction of network upgrades and transmission provider’s
interconnection facilities can commence quickly thereby streamlining the interconnection
process. With this revision, requiring the LGIA deposit to be returned at commercial
operation is now unnecessary as there will be no deposit remaining to return; therefore,
we decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to do so.1381
We also revise article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA to require transmission
providers to draft Appendix B (Milestones) of the interconnection customer’s LGIA to
clearly explain and estimate at which point of construction the interconnection
customer’s LGIA deposit will be depleted, and the interconnection customer must
provide additional financial security. In the event the interconnection customer requests
suspension of the LGIA under article 5.16 of its LGIA prior to the commencement of
construction, the transmission provider is prohibited from using the LGIA deposit to
commence construction until the interconnection customer requests to exit suspension
and resume construction, unless there is a need for the transmission provider to use a
portion of the LGIA deposit to ensure its system is left in a reliable condition during the
period of suspension.
We do not adopt the suggestion of Ørsted and Shell that, for interconnection
customers withdrawing their interconnection requests after executing an LGIA, all

deposits should be refunded if withdrawal is the result of circumstances outside the
interconnection customer’s control and the withdrawal does not harm other entities.1382
We believe that the exceptions to the application of withdrawal penalties discussed in the
Section III.A.6.e below appropriately balance the need to deter withdrawals with the
reality that withdrawal is not always due to circumstances within interconnection
customers’ control.
In response to Southern’s comments that making both study and LGIA deposits
refundable may not be stringent enough and therefore may not disincentivize speculative
interconnection requests,1383 we reiterate that, as adopted, the deposits serve different
functions. In this instance, the LGIA deposit serves as a credit towards the security the
interconnection customer must provide for network upgrades and transmission provider’s
interconnection facilities. To the extent the LGIA deposit pays for the construction of
network upgrades, such a deposit would be refunded through transmission credits in
regions that follow the pro forma LGIA provisions on crediting.

interconnection queue.1384 The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to
require transmission providers to assess withdrawal penalties to interconnection
customers in certain circumstances. Specifically, the Commission proposed to revise the
pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers to assess withdrawal penalties to
interconnection customers that choose to withdraw at any point in the interconnection
process or do not otherwise reach commercial operation, unless: (1) the withdrawal does
not delay the timing of other proposed generating facilities in the same cluster; (2) the
withdrawal does not increase the cost of network upgrades for other proposed generating
facilities in the same cluster; (3) the interconnection customer withdraws after receiving
the most recent cluster study report and the costs assigned to the interconnection
customer have increased 25% compared to the previous cluster study report; or (4) the
interconnection customer withdraws after receiving the individual facilities study report
and the costs assigned to the interconnection customer have increased by more than
100% compared to costs identified in the cluster study report.1385 Thus, the Commission
proposed that interconnection customers would be exempt from a withdrawal penalty if
the withdrawal does not harm other interconnection customers or if the withdrawal
follows a significant unanticipated increase in network upgrade cost estimates.
The Commission proposed that the withdrawal penalty would increase as the
interconnection customer moves through the study process and would also increase if an

interconnection customer provides a commercial readiness deposit in lieu of a
demonstration of commercial readiness.1386 For an interconnection customer that
provides a commercial readiness deposit in lieu of a demonstration of commercial
readiness, the Commission proposed that its withdrawal penalty would be higher and
increase as the interconnection customer progresses in the interconnection process.
The Commission proposed that the withdrawal penalty for an interconnection
customer that provides a commercial readiness deposit in lieu of a demonstration of
commercial readiness will be the greater of the study deposit or: (1) two times the study
cost if the customer withdraws during the cluster study or after receipt of a cluster study
report, capped at $1 million; (2) three times the study cost if the customer withdraws
during the cluster restudy or after receipt of any applicable restudy reports, capped at
$1.5 million; (3) five times the study cost if the customer withdraws during the facilities
study, after receipt of the individual facilities study report, or after receipt of the draft
LGIA, capped at $2 million; or (4) nine times the study costs if the customer withdraws
before achieving commercial operation and after executing the LGIA or filing an
unexecuted LGIA.1387 The Commission also proposed that the withdrawal penalty
revenues be used to fund studies conducted under the cluster study process.

including what criteria should be used to determine whether the withdrawal caused the
delay or increased cost, and whether to establish a threshold for when a delay or increase
in cost will trigger a withdrawal penalty (and if so, what that threshold should be);
(2) whether the Commission should consider exceptions to the proposed withdrawal
penalties beyond those proposed in the NOPR; (3) whether withdrawal penalties that
increase with proposed generating facility size (as measured by MW) would more
effectively deter withdrawals that cause the greatest harm; and (4) whether a correlation

level of harm (in terms of delays and increased cost) to other interconnection customers
as a result of the withdrawal.1390

certain of the other NOPR proposals, the Commission’s proposed withdrawal penalties
are appropriate to address the delays and costs caused by speculative interconnection
requests.1392 Eversource states that properly calibrated withdrawal penalties are essential
to dissuade withdrawals and reduce study process delays.1393
MISO supports the Commission’s proposal to impose a withdrawal penalty on
withdrawing interconnection customers, a penalty that MISO suggests should be secured
by the commercial readiness deposit.1394 That said, MISO asserts that the study cost for
interconnection requests is not that substantial, and MISO does not believe that paying a
withdrawal penalty in the amount of only the study costs would be a sufficient deterrent
to prevent speculative interconnection requests from entering or remaining in the

assumes that the interconnection customer has adequate visibility into likely

potential for discrimination against independent power producers.1401 These commenters
assert that LSEs can recover withdrawal penalties they incur from their retail ratepayers,
whereas independent power producers must absorb these costs and risks in their
solicitation process bids. Interwest also suggests that the proposed withdrawal penalties
are less likely to apply to LSEs than to independent power producers because LSEs will
likely be able to use the proposed commercial readiness demonstration path, as opposed
to paying the deposits in lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness, and would thus not
be subject to the harsher withdrawal penalties.1402 Interwest urges the Commission to
require waiver of, or a substantial reduction in, withdrawal penalties from the transition
cluster or resource solicitation cluster if the interconnection customer participated in an
RFP or other competitive solicitation process but was not ultimately selected, or if a
permit becomes unavailable due to some regulatory or regime change.1403

for commercially viable generating facilities or increase financing costs.1406 R Street
argues that the proposal is misguided because it would add another administrative process
that increases implementation complications and costs.1407 R Street suggests that the
Commission should instead use a simple loss of deposit as its financial lever.
rPlus argues that withdrawal penalties, particularly when coupled with the
proposed study deposit requirements and study cost allocations, are unduly
discriminatory or punitive to pumped storage as compared to other renewable
technologies.1408 rPlus and Hydropower Commenters claim that, under these proposals, a
large capacity pumped storage project (ranging from 400 MW to over 1,000 MW in size,
according to rPlus) would expect to hit the maximum deposit and/or penalty in every
stage of the interconnection process.1409 rPlus claims that the high cost of entry and the
liability associated with withdrawal may give large utilities an unfair advantage in
commercial negotiations.1410

the proposed commercial readiness requirements and financial commitments (for deposits
and site control).1411 Shell suggests that the Commission adopt withdrawal penalties
modeled on MISO’s framework, which encourages interconnection customers to
withdraw from the interconnection queue with refunded deposits rather than penalizing
interconnection customers for making justifiable decisions. Shell contends that there
should only be a large penalty for late-stage withdrawals.1412 Shell contends that,
otherwise, the Commission is sending the wrong signal and driving out competition
without linking the underlying issue of unexpected network upgrade costs that typically
come from affected system studies that are provided very late in the study process.
Some commenters contend that increasing the amount of money at stake for an
interconnection customer without providing off-ramps from the interconnection process
at reasonable decision points where previously unavailable information is supplied does
not necessarily incentivize interconnection customers to exit the interconnection
queue.1413 CREA and NewSun suggest that the proposed withdrawal penalties may
incentivize an interconnection customer to remain in the interconnection queue waiting
for other interconnection customers to withdraw, and the penalty those interconnection
customers pay will eventually be distributed to the remaining interconnection customers

Several commenters oppose the proposed withdrawal penalty amounts.1415 AEE
argues that the Commission’s proposed withdrawal penalty amounts are overly punitive,
especially for those interconnection customers that submit a deposit in lieu of
demonstrating commercial readiness, which many interconnection customers will be
forced to do under the Commission’s proposed commercial readiness requirements.1416
AEE and Clean Energy Associations assert that the Commission’s proposed withdrawal
penalty amounts also appear arbitrary, with no basis in the costs of conducting studies or
other relevant factors.1417 AEE argues that the Commission should reduce these amounts
and tie them more closely to its objectives and to the study costs that transmission
providers are expected to incur, which it asserts will avoid turning the penalties into a

punitive measure that provides a profit opportunity for transmission providers.1418 AEE
contends that the withdrawal penalty frameworks and time frames should be designed to
discipline the decisions of interconnection customers rather than being punitive. Google
does not support the proposal to impose higher withdrawal penalties on interconnection
customers that submit a deposit in lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness.1419
Interwest argues that some of the proposed withdrawal penalties—those in the
range of five to nine times the study costs—far exceed reasonableness, especially in the
face of the potential for a myriad of ways in which an LSE can bias the bid review
process and slow the cluster study process under existing rules without stringent
oversight.1420 Interwest argues that the NOPR does not sufficiently acknowledge the
need to reform study processes to prevent inaccurate studies, which create widely
different results from one study to another.1421 Interwest suggests that these inaccurate
studies, along with delayed affected system study results, lead to withdrawals,
strengthening the case that withdrawal penalties should not increase dramatically toward
the end of the study process and around execution of an LGIA without appropriate
recourse for the interconnection customer. Interwest argues that a 25% increase in study
costs from one study to another should be a sufficient basis for withdrawal without

incurring withdrawal penalties, as part of a tariff with incentives for transmission
providers to provide accurate estimates of network upgrade costs. Interwest argues that,
for these reasons, withdrawal penalties are redundant and punitive when combined with
increasingly large at-risk deposits as proof of commercial readiness.
SDG&E asserts that a withdrawal penalty of nine times the study deposit amount
will provide a disincentive for late-stage withdrawals in certain cases, but that a penalty
alone should not be relied on in lieu of other financial security mechanisms.1422 SDG&E
maintains that a more reasonable amount for a withdrawal penalty may be the greater of
nine times the study deposit and a CAISO-style financial security posting that is based on
factors such as network upgrade and interconnection facilities costs.
Some commenters argue that the Commission should adopt the RTO/ISO model
of financial readiness milestones that are tied to network upgrade costs.1423 Clean Energy
Associations submit that tying deposits and penalties to network upgrade costs allocated
to the interconnection customer is superior because network upgrade costs are a better
indicator of the harm that may be caused by a withdrawal than generating facility size.1424

upgrade deposit at risk provides a better incentive for interconnection customers with

proposed generating facilities with high network upgrade costs to withdraw earlier in the
interconnection process, rather than risk losing their posted security.1425 Invenergy
suggests that any withdrawal penalty imposed after LGIA execution should be tied to
assigned network upgrade costs and should be subject to a $2 million cap to avoid
unnecessarily punitive penalties, as the LGIA may impose additional financial
obligations for construction of the assigned upgrades.1426 CAISO argues that network
upgrade-based financial requirements are far more effective than the withdrawal penalties
proposed in the NOPR because network upgrade-based requirements are tied to the
project’s actual interconnection costs, which correlate with its competitiveness to obtain a
power purchase agreement and therefore its likelihood to remain in the queue.1427
NYISO argues that the withdrawal penalty amounts proposed in the NOPR, which
are tied to study costs, are unlikely to provide sufficient capital to cover the costs of
constructing the network upgrades of withdrawn generating facilities on which other
interconnection customers are relying.1428 SoCal Edison suggests that, instead of using
study costs as the basis for the withdrawal penalty amount, which would not be known
until completion of the interconnection studies, the Commission should require that

Proposed Withdrawal Penalty
Exemptions

Some commenters support the NOPR proposal to exempt interconnection
customers from withdrawal penalties in certain instances, stating that the proposal
achieves a workable balance between the needs of interconnection customers and
transmission providers.1430 For example, MISO agrees that interconnection requests that
experience significant cost increases should be able to withdraw without a penalty.1431
Omaha Public Power states that the four scenarios proposed in the NOPR for
interconnection customers to qualify for exemptions to withdrawal penalties seem to
properly acknowledge instances where other interconnection customers are not
negatively impacted by a withdrawal, or when it is no longer economically viable for the
interconnection customer to move forward with the generating facility due to drastically
increased network upgrade costs.1432

interconnection customers from withdrawal penalties if there is no impact to other

generating facilities in the same cluster, withdrawals almost always impact other
generating facilities in the cluster, such that withdrawal penalties are likely
unavoidable.1433 Pine Gate states that the proposed list of withdrawal penalty exemptions
is not reflective of an appropriate balance between interconnection customer and
transmission provider accountability because it increases the burden on interconnection
customers without any increase to accountability for transmission providers.1434 Pattern
Energy disagrees with a standard tied to a potential delay of a lower-queued
interconnection customer, given the Commission’s proposed transition to a cluster study
approach.1435 Pattern Energy contends that the only impact that should be relevant to
granting an exemption is a financial impact.
NRECA supports including the 100% cost increase exemption in the final rule,
which would apply where there is a large late-stage cost increase, making the
interconnection request’s success economically challenging.1436 Pattern Energy, on the
other hand, claims that the Commission’s proposal incentivizes transmission providers to
overestimate costs in cluster studies for fear that there will be later, unexpected cost
increases in the facilities study, which Pattern Energy argues presents a barrier to

Xcel recommends that the Commission allow an interconnection request,
submitted by a resource planning entity as agent for an interconnection customer, that is
withdrawn by the resource planning entity because it was not picked in a resource
solicitation process, to be exempt from withdrawal penalties, as the withdrawal was due
to no fault of the interconnection customer.1440 Xcel states that, other than this
exemption, the Commission should not expand the exemptions from withdrawal penalties
beyond those proposed in the NOPR.
NextEra and Northwest and Intermountain argue that interconnection customers
should be exempt from withdrawal penalties if the transmission provider’s or affected
system operator’s studies or posted information are untimely.1441
NextEra contends that the NOPR does not explain why there are different
withdrawal penalty levels for interconnection customers demonstrating commercial
readiness via the proposed non-financial demonstration options and those submitting a
deposit in lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness.1442
Several commenters argue that the proposed exemptions require clarification.1443

workable.1444 CAISO argues that the Commission’s description of the exemptions is
problematic due to the use of “or,” which suggests meeting any criterion would relieve
the interconnection customer of withdrawal penalties. CAISO posits that, under the
Commission’s criteria, a withdrawal could not affect the timing of other generating
facilities but still increase their costs; however, the interconnection customer would meet
the first exemption and not be subject to withdrawal penalties. CAISO argues that
withdrawals would never delay the timing of generating facilities in the same cluster.
CAISO states that a cluster’s upgrades are a package, and the construction schedule
would not change simply because one interconnection customer that is sharing upgrades
withdraws. CAISO suggests that the Commission clarify that, to be exempt from
withdrawal penalties, each interconnection customer must meet (1) both criterion one and
two, and (2) criterion three or four.
Invenergy proposes that the list of exemptions to withdrawal penalties be revised
to include: (1) the withdrawal does not directly cause material delays in the timing of
other interconnection requests within the same cluster, as determined at the time of
withdrawal by the transmission provider; or (2) the withdrawal does not directly cause a
material increase in the costs assigned to other interconnection requests within the same
cluster, as determined at the time of withdrawal by the transmission provider.

Omaha Public Power contends that the exemption to withdrawal penalties cannot
be applied to the interconnection process as it currently functions for those transmission
providers that allow for overlapping studies (e.g., when a cluster study is being studied
prior to the conclusion of the preceding cluster study).1445 Omaha Public Power claims
that overlapping studies lead to baseline costs in the subsequent cluster studies that are
inherently wrong and do not factor in the previously existing unfinished cluster studies.
Omaha Public Power claims that this inaccurate starting point for costs is likely higher
than what is accurate, and any subsequent restudy will likely lead to identification of
network upgrades that fall below the exemption threshold, subjecting interconnection
customers to wrongful withdrawal penalties. Omaha Public Power argues that, until an
interconnection process can be conducted without overlapping studies, these exemptions
will be woefully misapplied. Southern raises similar concerns.1446
Yet other commenters believe that the NOPR proposal is too lenient.1447 NRECA
suggests that transmission providers should be afforded flexibility whether to adopt
exemptions to withdrawal penalties related to: (1) not delaying the timing of other
interconnection requests in the same cluster; (2) not increasing the cost of network
upgrades for other interconnection requests in the same cluster; and (3) withdrawing if
the most recent cluster study report shows a cost increase of at least 25% compared to the

previous cluster study report.1448 NRECA asserts that these exemptions may or may not
be needed for a particular transmission provider and potentially may allow withdrawals
that trigger time-consuming restudy processes. SDG&E generally opposes exemptions to
withdrawal penalties and claims that material modification provisions in the pro forma
LGIP already address impacts to other interconnection customers.1449 SDG&E argues
that, regardless of the impact to other interconnection customers, there are still costs and
resources committed between all entities to study and assess proposed generating
facilities. SDG&E believes that withdrawal penalties should apply for all generating
facilities, and any exemptions should be sparing.

How to Determine if a Withdrawal
Has Delayed or Increased the Cost of
Network Upgrades for Other
Generating Facilities in the Same
Cluster

Some commenters argue that it would be difficult to define the circumstances
under which a withdrawal is deemed to have delayed the timing or increased the cost of
network upgrades for other interconnection requests in the same cluster.1450 APS and
Bonneville argue that attempting to do so would create an undue burden on transmission
providers, and that the withdrawal of an interconnection request could have an impact on

generating facilities in a subsequent cluster.1451 NextEra suggests that one test to
determine whether a withdrawal delays other interconnection requests could be whether
the withdrawal delays the planned in-service date of other interconnection requests in the
same cluster.1452 However, NextEra acknowledges that even this assessment could be
difficult to calculate, as delays could not manifest themselves for months or years, other
factors could cause delays, and interconnection customers could seek to delay their
generating facilities for commercial reasons. Pattern Energy asserts that the Commission
must clearly define the standard for timing delays and increasing the cost of network
upgrades for other interconnection customers.1453
Bonneville suggests that, similar to the method used to assess a material
modification under the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP, the Commission could
provide a non-exhaustive list of examples that would be deemed as delaying the timing or
increasing the costs of network upgrades.1454 Bonneville suggests that transmission
providers could be given discretion to determine whether other withdrawal situations that
are not listed should fall under this category by considering whether the withdrawal has
delayed the timing or increased the cost of network upgrades for other interconnection
requests in a cluster.

Invenergy argues that transmission providers should not be permitted to simply
assume that withdrawals cause some harm to other interconnection requests and that there
should be a requirement for transmission providers to perform an analysis to determine
whether a withdrawal results in material harm to other interconnection requests, which
interconnection customers could review.1455 Invenergy states that the analysis of whether
a withdrawal causes a cost increase or delays the timing for other interconnection
requests should be performed at each phase of the study process.
Invenergy requests that the Commission clarify that a withdrawal will not delay
the timing of another interconnection request or increase its network upgrade costs if the
withdrawal simply requires the transmission provider to account for the withdrawal.
Invenergy requests that the Commission clarify that any delay or cost increase analysis
must be based on a reasonable analysis and show a direct relationship between the
withdrawal and the asserted impact on another interconnection request.
MISO encourages the Commission to impose the withdrawal penalty whenever an
interconnection request withdraws from the interconnection queue.1456 MISO argues that
even if after restudy it turns out that the withdrawal of an interconnection request did not
actually increase network upgrade costs to other interconnection customers in the cluster,
the withdrawal still negatively impacts the interconnection queue by increasing
uncertainty for other interconnection customers, prompting further withdrawals and

adding administrative cost and burden that impede efficient interconnection queue
processing. Pattern Energy likewise argues that the withdrawal of any interconnection
request from the interconnection queue results in some form of delay, such as the time
taken by a transmission provider to perform a review of the potential impacts of the
withdrawal, which could be interpreted as causing a delay because the withdrawal impact
analysis could delay the receipt of final study results and agreements.1457 PJM makes
similar arguments.1458
Xcel contends that, if a withdrawal results in a restudy of a cluster or subsequent
clusters, that restudy will delay the receipt of study results, LGIA execution, and the
construction of required network upgrades.1459 Therefore, Xcel argues that any
withdrawal that results in a restudy should not be exempt from a withdrawal penalty
unless the commercial operation dates of other impacted interconnection requests in the
same or subsequent cluster are not impacted. Xcel asserts that delaying LGIA execution
may negatively impact off-take agreements and should also be considered harm to
equally or lower-queued interconnection customers. Xcel notes that harm is not limited
to the reallocation of interconnection costs to equally or lower-queued interconnection
requests. Xcel contends that delays, resulting in clogged interconnection queues, can
impact resource decisions and thus harm interconnection requests not yet in the

interconnection queue. Xcel argues that, if the withdrawal causes restudy, but the restudy
does not impact the timing discussed above, then the restudy results should be used to
determine the impact on costs allocated to equally or lower-queued interconnection
requests.
Xcel notes that it may be difficult to determine if a single withdrawal would have
caused harm when multiple interconnection requests are withdrawn in the same time
frame.1460 Xcel generally supports penalizing withdrawals if they have a combined
impact, as it would be difficult, if not impossible and time consuming, to determine each
individual withdrawal’s impact. According to Xcel, if the withdrawal penalty was
determined on an individual basis, some interconnection customers may wait for others to
withdraw, then argue that their secondary withdrawals did not have an impact because all
delays and cost impacts were caused by the first withdrawal.
Indicated PJM TOs state that a withdrawal can impose costs on other
interconnection customers even if it does not delay the timing of other proposed
generating facilities. Indicated PJM TOs argue that if withdrawals impose more network
upgrade costs on other interconnection customers, it would be unfair to excuse
withdrawing interconnection customers just because the transmission provider can keep
to its original timelines.1461 Indicated PJM TOs further claim that, particularly in a large
RTO/ISO, it is not clear how the transmission provider would determine that a particular

Withdrawal Penalty Collection and
Distribution

APS seeks clarification on the mechanism the Commission proposes for
transmission providers to collect withdrawal penalties from interconnection
customers.1462 APS and MISO express concerns that, under the withdrawal penalty
collection proposal, a transmission provider would have to act as a collection agency,
which is likely unworkable.1463 EEI suggests that the Commission institute financial
assurance requirements for interconnection customers to reduce the likelihood that
penalized entities are unable to pay the penalties they are assessed.1464 Eversource asserts
that the Commission should set clear rules that include policies governing how
RTOs/ISOs will collect penalties and address potential scenarios in which
interconnection customers refuse to pay or declare bankruptcy.1465 MISO claims that

interconnection customers can structure the businesses behind the interconnection request
in such a way so that the legal entity would be very difficult to collect from.1466
Some commenters do not support the Commission’s proposal to require
withdrawal penalty revenues to be used to fund studies conducted under the cluster study
process.1467 CAISO states that transmission providers already have provisions specifying
where non-refundable funds go, and using them for interconnection studies would require
careful accounting without relieving study burdens.1468 NextEra and PJM suggest that
transmission providers should be allowed to use forfeited funds to help pay for increased
network upgrade costs incurred by other interconnection customers due to a
withdrawal.1469 Invenergy asserts that excess funds should be applied to offset network
upgrade costs assigned through that cluster study process in proportion to any upgrade
costs that were directly shifted from a withdrawn interconnection customer.1470 RWE

contend that withdrawal penalties should be allocated between and among different
clusters for transmission expansion, so that they benefit load and interconnection
customers, rather than restudies, which they believe will not be needed as frequently in
the proposed cluster study process.1472
CAISO opposes the NOPR proposal to cap withdrawal penalties.1473 CAISO
contends that larger projects create the most churn in queue, and projects that cannot
demonstrate commercial readiness should be the most likely to withdraw. CAISO argues
that withdrawal penalty caps will disproportionately affect smaller and more competitive
interconnection requests more than larger and less competitive interconnection requests
and suggests that the Commission remove the withdrawal penalty caps so the withdrawal
penalties affect interconnection customers equally.
Pattern Energy suggests that, in addition to the Commission’s proposed use of
withdrawal penalties to defray future study costs, the Commission should designate a
portion of any withdrawal penalties to be used for recruitment, retention, and
performance bonuses for engineers, administrators, and/or consultants, who can then be
deployed to help alleviate queue backlogs.1474

Other commenters request clarification of the proposal for distribution of
withdrawal penalty funds. AES and EDF Renewables argue that it is critical that the
Commission clarify that transmission providers do not receive any benefits from
withdrawal fee and non-refundable deposit proceeds; otherwise, they argue, transmission

refunded to the interconnection customer.1478 On the other hand, Southern opposes

remaining amounts be applied to network upgrades needed in the same cluster or treated
as a revenue credit against the revenue requirement in the determination of transmission
rates.1479 APS suggests that the remainder act as a credit towards the transmission

customers benefit from the penalties.1480
Shell claims that withdrawal penalties will accumulate faster than they may be
spent by the relevant transmission provider.1481 Therefore, Shell asserts that the
Commission must address the following: (1) the system of independent checks and
balances that transmission providers will employ to ensure that only specific individuals
have access to the withdrawal penalty account; (2) the average cost of a cluster study
from start to finish so that, if a withdrawal penalty is forfeited, it can be determined how
many future cluster studies the transmission provider could expect to perform with
forfeited funds; (3) if funds from a withdrawal penalty are used to pay for future study
costs, whether future interconnection customers must still post a study deposit; and (4) if
a withdrawal penalty account balance accumulates faster than funds can be spent, what
independent system of checks and balances transmission providers will use to ensure that
their staff and/or consultants do not overcharge for their services related to studies.

monetary amounts to substantially reduce the risk that the efforts of interconnection

requests.1487
Some commenters seek general clarification on several of the withdrawal penalty
proposals. For example, NV Energy requests clarification on whether, if a withdrawal
penalty is deemed appropriate at the time an interconnection customer withdraws its
interconnection request, that the interconnection customer is charged both the actual costs
incurred to perform studies and the applicable withdrawal penalty (i.e., two separate
charges).1488
NV Energy seeks clarification, if an interconnection customer’s generating facility
does not achieve commercial operation, whether the nine times the actual study cost
deposit would be applied toward its withdrawal penalties, and whether the
interconnection customer would be charged nine times the actual study costs.
Southern suggests that, in the NOPR’s proposed definition of “withdrawal
penalty” and in the exemptions to that penalty, the phrase “the commercial operation date
in the interconnection request” should replace the phrase “commercial operation,” such
that the definition would read “the penalty assessed by Transmission Provider to an
Interconnection Customer that chooses to withdraw from the queue or does not otherwise
reach the Commercial Operation Date in the Interconnection Request.”1489 Southern

argues that to be consistent and clear with pro forma LGIP section 3.7.1.1, the definition
of withdrawal penalty must be revised to reflect that the withdrawal penalty is applicable
if the interconnection customer is deemed withdrawn.

withdrawal penalties that increase with the proposed generating facility size.1497 For
example, Idaho Power contends that large generating facilities typically trigger more
expensive network upgrades which, when withdrawn, are more likely to trigger
restudies.1498 Other commenters do not support withdrawal penalties that increase based
on the size of a generating facility.1499 APS argues that the determinant of “relative level
of harm” is entirely subjective to the transmission provider and could lead to
litigation.1500 APS argues that the location of the interconnection request is more closely
correlated with the effect on other interconnection customers than is the size of a
proposed generating facility. Xcel states that, although larger generating facilities tend to
have a larger impact, if the total impact to other projects is calculated as a combined
impact, then the size of the project should not impact the withdrawal penalty
calculation.1501
Ørsted expresses concern that relatively small generating facilities (by MW) that
fail to demonstrate commercial readiness and are forced to withdraw from the
interconnection queue pose significant threats to the efficient management of the cluster

study process and recommends that withdrawal penalties be correlated to an
interconnection customer’s commercial readiness.1502
AEP supports the idea of off-ramp opportunities at specific times in the cluster
study process rather than having to analyze individual withdrawal impacts throughout a
cluster study process.1503 AEP contends that such an approach should limit restudies and
minimize delays to remaining interconnection customers. Similarly, PJM asserts that
only allowing withdrawals during certain decision points ensures that studies start and
finish at the same time and that the cluster status is maintained during the duration of the
study.1504 According to PJM, allowing withdrawals at any point in the study process, as
proposed in the NOPR, even with relevant penalties assessed, will cause cascading
restudies and negative impacts on other interconnection customers in a cluster.
SPP states that, under its current LGIP, interconnection customers provide
progressively increasing financial security deposits at each stage of the study process, and
the amounts of the financial security deposits required to enter into later stages of the
study process are based on the amount of network upgrade costs assigned in the previous
stage, which it asserts is better related to the risk and harm of a withdrawal than the
NOPR proposal.1505

Rather than being assessed withdrawal penalties, CREA and NewSun assert that
interconnection customers should be refunded any unused study deposits.1506 CREA and
NewSun argue that penalties should apply only to deter wrongful conduct that the
interconnection customer can avoid committing and should not be used as an arbitrary
barrier to market entry.1507

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modifications, the NOPR proposal to impose withdrawal penalties
on interconnection customers for withdrawing their interconnection requests from the
interconnection queue, absent qualification for one of the limited exemptions, as
discussed below. We add the defined term “withdrawal penalty,” as modified below, to
the pro forma LGIP; revise section 3.7 of the pro forma LGIP; and add sections 3.7.1,
3.7.1.1, and 3.7.1.2 to the pro forma LGIP, with the modifications to the NOPR proposal
discussed below. However, we decline to adopt the withdrawal penalty caps proposed in
the NOPR.
We find that, along with the other reforms adopted in this final rule, adopting a
withdrawal penalty framework is needed to remedy the issues regarding speculative
interconnection requests, including study delays from overcrowded interconnection
queues and the harms to the function of the interconnection queue that occur when
interconnection customers withdraw from the interconnection queue at various stages of

the study process. We believe that withdrawal penalties—as adopted herein—will
encourage interconnection customers to ensure that their proposed generating facilities
are likely commercially viable when they submit their interconnection requests because
withdrawal, in most instances, will incur a penalty. We adopt withdrawal penalties that
increase in amount as interconnection customers proceed through the interconnection
process in order to ensure that interconnection customers continue to evaluate whether
their proposed generating facilities are commercially viable, thereby reducing the number
of late-stage withdrawals and accompanying restudies.1508 We additionally modify the
proposal, as discussed below, regarding how the withdrawal penalty funds are distributed.
Specifically, after withdrawal penalty funds are used to fund studies conducted under the
cluster study process in the same cluster, as proposed in the NOPR, we modify the
proposal to require any remaining withdrawal penalty funds be used to offset net
increases to network upgrade cost assignments experienced by interconnection customers
from the same cluster that remain in the interconnection queue and are directly affected
by the withdrawal of an interconnection request because they previously shared an
obligation to fund a network upgrade1509 with the withdrawn interconnection request in

1508

See RWE Renewables Initial Comments at 2 (asserting that withdrawal
penalties should be used to create meaningful decision points for interconnection
customers to demonstrate project commitment through the interconnection process).
1509

Sharing an obligation means (1) interconnecting to the same substation
network upgrade, or (2) in the case of a system network upgrade, where interconnection
customers are identified through the proportional impact method, as contributing to the
need for the same system network upgrade.

the same cluster.1510 If the interconnection customer withdraws before it executes its
LGIA or requests to file its LGIA unexecuted and after the interconnection customers in
the same cluster that the withdrawn interconnection customer participated in have
executed LGIAs, requested their LGIAs to be filed unexecuted, or withdrawn (or have
been deemed withdrawn), any remaining withdrawal penalty funds not applied to study
costs or net increases in network upgrade cost assignments must be returned to the
withdrawn interconnection customer.1511
As explained in Section II of this final rule, we find that Commissionjurisdictional rates have been rendered unjust and unreasonable due to speculative
interconnection requests that enter and remain in the interconnection queue. By
incentivizing interconnection customers to submit interconnection requests only for
proposed generating facilities that they believe will be commercially viable and to remain
in the interconnection queue only as long as that continues to be true, and by offsetting
increases in network upgrade cost responsibility experienced by interconnection
customers directly affected by a withdrawal because they share an obligation to fund a

PJM Initial Comments at 39; Southern Initial Comments at 22 (suggesting that
transmission providers should be allowed to use forfeited funds to help pay for increased
network upgrade costs incurred by other interconnection customers in the same cluster
due to a withdrawal). We disagree with RWE Renewables and Interwest that withdrawal
penalties should be allocated between and among different clusters because we find that
withdrawal penalties should only be allocated to interconnection customers that are
directly affected by a withdrawal because they share an obligation to fund a network
upgrade. See RWE Renewables Initial Comments at 2; Interwest Reply Comments at 14.

network upgrade with the withdrawn interconnection request in the same cluster, we
believe that the withdrawal penalty requirements will work in tandem with the other
reforms adopted in this final rule to remedy those unjust and unreasonable rates.
Specifically, we adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to revise the pro
forma LGIP to require the transmission provider to assess withdrawal penalties, unless an
exemption applies at any point in the interconnection process. The withdrawal penalties
will be applied to an interconnection customer if: (1) the interconnection customer
withdraws its interconnection request at any point in the interconnection process; (2) the
interconnection customer’s interconnection request has been deemed withdrawn by the
transmission provider at any point in the interconnection process; or (3) the
interconnection customer’s generating facility does not reach commercial operation (such
as when an interconnection customer’s LGIA is terminated prior to reaching commercial
operation). We note that a withdrawal could trigger minor adjustments to the study
results of the remaining equally- or lower-queued interconnection requests that do not
represent a significant harm to those remaining in the queue. Therefore, we are
modifying the NOPR proposal to require the transmission provider to assess a withdrawal
penalty only if the withdrawal has a material impact on the cost or timing of any
interconnection requests with an equal or lower queue position. If the transmission
provider determines that the impact of the withdrawal is immaterial, the transmission
provider must not assess a withdrawal penalty.
We adopt this provision in place of the NOPR proposal to exempt interconnection
customers from withdrawal penalties if: (1) the withdrawal does not delay the timing of

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 512 -

other proposed generating facilities in the same cluster; or (2) the withdrawal does not
increase the cost of network upgrades for other proposed generating facilities. We adopt
the NOPR proposal that the interconnection customer will also be exempt from paying a
withdrawal penalty if (1) the interconnection customer withdraws its interconnection
request after receiving the most recent cluster study report and the network upgrade costs
assigned to the interconnection customer’s request have increased 25% compared to the
previous cluster study report, or (2) the interconnection customer withdraws its
interconnection request after receiving the individual facilities study report and the
network upgrade costs assigned to the interconnection customer’s request have increased
by more than 100% compared to costs identified in the cluster study report. Accordingly,
with these exemptions from the withdrawal penalty, the required withdrawal penalty
approach adopted herein does not allow for penalties if the impact of the withdrawal is
immaterial to other interconnection customers or if the withdrawal follows significant,
unanticipated increases in network upgrade cost estimates.
For the withdrawal penalty exemptions, we clarify that the relevant cost increases
are network upgrade cost estimate increases, and we adopt revisions to the pro forma
LGIP accordingly. This clarification is consistent with the Commission’s description of
these exemptions in the NOPR: “Thus, under this proposal, interconnection customers
would be exempt from a withdrawal penalty . . . if the withdrawal follows a significant
unanticipated increase in network upgrade cost estimates.”1512

We disagree with commenters that the thresholds to trigger the exemptions—a
25% increase in estimated network upgrade costs above the cluster study report estimate
or a 100% increase in estimated network upgrade costs in the facilities study report—are
too high. As an initial matter, the potential interconnection customer will have access to
heatmap information, as required in this final rule, that will allow it to evaluate project
feasibility without a financial commitment and thereby avoid potential withdrawal
penalty risk. As stated by Omaha Public Power and Southern, upon entering the
interconnection queue and receiving the estimates provided in the cluster study report, the
interconnection customer is aware that the estimates may change. Additionally, we find
that the trigger thresholds are set at an amount that provides sufficient room for estimates
to change as the cluster evolves while limiting interconnection customer exposure to
withdrawal penalties when such estimates change by a significant amount. Moreover, the
increasing threshold triggers reflect the fact that estimates should improve in accuracy as
interconnection customers move through the interconnection process and should
increasingly disincentivize commercially non-viable generating facilities from staying in
the interconnection queue. An interconnection customer will know to factor in both the
cost estimates and the potential withdrawal penalty but also the exemption trigger
thresholds as it proceeds through the interconnection queue.
We do not believe that interconnection customers will be subject to “wrongful
withdrawal penalties” as suggested by some commenters. In addition, the withdrawal
penalty exemptions are designed to allow penalty-free withdrawal if the withdrawal does
not materially harm other interconnection customers or if the withdrawal follows a

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 514 -

significant unanticipated increase in network upgrade cost estimates. The withdrawal
penalty exemptions are not designed to mitigate all business risk associated with
interconnecting a new generating facility. The withdrawal penalty structure adopted
herein, where the withdrawal penalty at the earlier stages of the interconnection process is
generally lower than the withdrawal penalty at later stages also lessens the cost exposure
for an interconnection customer that withdraws at an earlier stage, when the impact of the
withdrawal is less disruptive to the administration of the interconnection queue and other
interconnection customers. We find that, by increasing the withdrawal penalty amounts
as the interconnection customer proceeds through the interconnection queue,
interconnection customers will be incentivized to withdraw non-viable interconnection
requests earlier in the process, leading to fewer late-stage withdrawals.
We also disagree with commenters that request additional exemptions to the
withdrawal penalty structure. We believe that the withdrawal penalty exemptions and
withdrawal penalty structure, as modified by this final rule, will deter unwarranted
assessments of withdrawal penalties.
Regarding commenters’ requests for clarification concerning how to determine
whether a withdrawal impacts other interconnection requests with the same or lower
queue positions for purposes of assessing qualification for an exemption to a withdrawal
penalty, we defer to the transmission provider’s discretion because the transmission
provider is best suited to determine whether a withdrawal has a material impact on the
cost or timing of any interconnection customer with the same or lower queue position.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

We do not adopt the NOPR proposal regarding withdrawal penalty calculations for
interconnection customers that provide demonstrations of commercial readiness because
we do not adopt the non-financial commercial readiness demonstration options in this
final rule, as discussed above in Section III.A.6.c.iii. Instead, we modify the proposed
penalty structure to base the withdrawal penalty calculation on an increasing percentage
of the cost of the identified network upgrades assigned to the interconnection customer as
the interconnection customer moves through the interconnection queue.1513 We also
decline to adopt the withdrawal penalty caps proposed in the NOPR. We believe that this
structure will provide better financial incentives for interconnection customers to avoid
late-stage withdrawals that cause the greatest disruption to interconnection queue
processing via restudies and delays because interconnection customers will be subject to
higher withdrawal penalties late in the interconnection process.
With regard to the withdrawal penalty calculation structure more specifically, we
modify the NOPR proposal and require that, unless an interconnection customer qualifies
for one of the stated exemptions discussed above, the transmission provider must assess a
withdrawal penalty on an interconnection customer with a proposed generating facility
that does not reach commercial operation based either on the actual study costs or on a
percentage of the interconnection customer’s assigned network upgrade costs, depending

on what phase the interconnection customer withdraws its interconnection request. Thus,
the withdrawal penalty for an interconnection customer will be calculated as the greater
of the study deposit or: (1) two times the study cost if the interconnection customer
withdraws during the cluster study or after receipt of a cluster study report; (2) 5% of the
interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade costs if the interconnection
customer withdraws during the cluster restudy or after receipt of any applicable restudy
reports; (3) 10% of the interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade costs if the
interconnection customer withdraws during the facilities study, after receipt of the
individual facilities study report, or after receipt of the draft LGIA; or (4) 20% of the
interconnection customer’s identified network upgrade costs if, after executing, or
requesting to file unexecuted, the LGIA, the interconnection customer’s LGIA is
terminated before its generating facility achieves commercial operation. The table below

We find that the withdrawal penalty structure adopted herein, which requires
larger withdrawal penalties as the interconnection customer progresses through the
interconnection process, combined with the exemptions, strikes the proper balance
between enabling interconnection customers that possess imperfect information when
entering into and remaining in the interconnection queue to make withdrawal decisions
and deterring speculative interconnection requests from entering into and remaining in
the queue when they are unlikely to be completed, to the detriment of other
interconnection customers, especially when these interconnection requests are withdrawn
at later stages of the interconnection process.
We decline to adopt the withdrawal penalty caps proposed in the NOPR because
such caps would mute the economic signals that withdrawal penalties are intended to
send to interconnection customers in the interconnection queue. The withdrawal penalty
structure is meant to incentivize interconnection customers to withdraw from the
interconnection queue upon receipt of network upgrade cost assignments that make the
interconnection request commercially non-viable. However, withdrawal penalty caps
would shield interconnection customers that withdraw due to higher-cost network
upgrades from consequences proportional to the impact of that withdrawal, which can

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

drive cascading withdrawals, creating the need for restudies and leading to delays. We
accordingly agree with CAISO that the withdrawal penalty caps proposed in the NOPR
would disproportionately benefit interconnection requests for larger generating
facilities.1514 We find that, while withdrawal penalty caps protect interconnection
customers that are allocated relatively high network upgrade costs, they offer no such
commensurate protection for interconnection customers with lower network upgrade cost
assignments, reflecting an imbalanced withdrawal penalty structure.
We also adopt and modify the proposed definition of “withdrawal penalty” in
section 1 of the pro forma LGIP to address situations in which it may be unclear what it
means to be withdrawn from the interconnection queue. Specifically, we clarify that a
withdrawal penalty applies when an interconnection customer actively chooses to
withdraw its interconnection request but also when its interconnection request is deemed
to have been withdrawn from the interconnection queue for one reason or another, or if it
otherwise does not reach commercial operation, per the terms of the pro forma LGIP.
Commenters observe that, under the NOPR proposal, interconnection customers
with large projects (in terms of MW) would be subject to large withdrawal penalties.1515
While this is true for the initial withdrawal penalty, which continues to be based on
project size because it is tied to study costs, the modification to the NOPR proposal

described above, where later withdrawal penalties are based on percentages of identified
network upgrade costs, reflects the potential impact of a withdrawal on the remaining
interconnection customers in a cluster. Additionally, as some commenters point out,
there is typically a correlation between the size of the proposed generating facility and the
relative harm to other interconnection customers from the withdrawal of the
interconnection request, so we believe that basing the initial withdrawal penalty on
project size is appropriate.1516
Because we modify the process for distributing withdrawal penalty funds in
response to comments, as described below, transmission providers will not accumulate
large amounts of funds from withdrawal penalties, and therefore Shell’s concerns are
moot.1517
Furthermore, we believe the proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.7.1.2 requirement
that transmission providers post on their OASIS site, and update quarterly, the balance of
withdrawal penalty revenue held by them but not yet dispersed, and the instructions of
how to distribute withdrawal penalty funds contained in this provision provide sufficient
transparency to help interested parties understand, monitor, and review withdrawal
penalty funds. Transmission providers have substantial experience collecting and

accounting for fees assessed to customers, and we will not mandate here what accounting
method they should use for the collection and tracking of withdrawal penalties.
With respect to the distribution of withdrawal penalty funds, we adopt the NOPR
proposal to require transmission providers to use withdrawal penalty funds to fund
studies and restudies conducted under the cluster study process, with modification.
Specifically, we adopt a structure whereby, if interconnection customers withdraw and
are subject to withdrawal penalties, the transmission provider must use the withdrawal
penalty funds as follows: (1) to fund studies and restudies in the same cluster; (2) if
withdrawal penalty funds remain, to offset net increases in costs borne by other
remaining interconnection customers from the same cluster for network upgrades shared
by both the withdrawing and non-withdrawing interconnection customers prior to the
withdrawal; and (3) if any withdrawal penalty funds remain, they will be returned to the
withdrawing interconnection customer.
We believe that using withdrawal penalty funds to reduce network upgrade cost
shifts caused by withdrawals will reduce the risk that the shifted costs are so large as to
cause cascading withdrawals, thus ensuring that interconnection customers are able to
interconnect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner. We agree with
Invenergy that it is appropriate for there to be a relationship between the impact caused
by the withdrawal of an interconnection request and how the withdrawal penalty funds
are distributed. We also are persuaded by Invenergy, PJM, NextEra, and Southern that
there are benefits to distributing withdrawal penalty funds to other interconnection
customers remaining in the cluster to offset increased network upgrade costs resulting

from the withdrawal.1518 We therefore modify the NOPR proposal and revise section
3.7.1 of the pro forma LGIP consistent with the discussion below.
In the paragraphs that follow we summarize the steps a transmission provider must
follow in distributing withdrawal penalty funds, as fully detailed in section 3.7.1.2 of the
pro forma LGIP, and we present an illustrative example.
Section 3.7.1.2.1 of the pro forma LGIP describes the transmission provider’s
handling of withdrawal penalty funds and the first step of distributing them to fund
studies and restudies. For a single cluster, the transmission provider shall hold all
withdrawal penalty funds until all interconnection customers in that cluster have: (1)
withdrawn or been deemed withdrawn; (2) executed an LGIA; or (3) requested an LGIA
to be filed unexecuted. Any withdrawal penalty funds collected shall first be used to fund
studies for interconnection customers in the same cluster that have executed an LGIA or
requested an LGIA to be filed unexecuted. Distribution of the withdrawal penalty funds
for such study costs shall not exceed the total actual study costs.
Section 3.7.1.2.2 of the pro forma LGIP provides that if, after the first distribution
step is complete, withdrawal penalty funds remain, the transmission provider must
proceed to the second step of distributing them to offset net increases in network upgrade
cost assignments driven by the withdrawal. The transmission provider will determine if
the withdrawn interconnection customers, at any point in the cluster study process, shared

cost assignment for one or more network upgrades with any remaining interconnection
customers in the same cluster based on the cluster study report, cluster restudy report(s),
interconnection facilities study report, and any subsequent issued restudy report for the
cluster.
If the transmission provider determines that withdrawn interconnection customers
shared cost assignment for network upgrades with remaining interconnection customers
in the same cluster, the transmission provider will calculate the remaining interconnection
customers’ net increase in costs (i.e., financial impact) due to a shared cost assignment
for network upgrades with the withdrawn interconnection customer. It will then
distribute withdrawal penalty funds as described in section 3.7.1.2.3 of the pro forma
LGIP, depending on whether the withdrawal occurred before the withdrawing
interconnection customer executed an LGIA (i.e., during the cluster study process) or
after.
If the transmission provider determines that more than one interconnection
customer in the same cluster was financially impacted by the same withdrawn
interconnection customer, the transmission provider will apply the relevant withdrawn
interconnection customer’s withdrawal penalty to reduce the financial impact to each
impacted interconnection customer based on each withdrawn interconnection customer’s
proportional share of the financial impact. Each interconnection customer’s proportional
share will be determined by either the proportional impact method if the net cost increase
is related to a system network upgrade or on a per capita basis if the net cost increase is
related to a substation network upgrade.

Section 3.7.1.2.4 of the pro forma LGIP details the process by which the
transmission provider will provide amended LGIAs to any interconnection customers in
the cluster that qualify for distribution of withdrawal penalty funds under this framework.
To account for withdrawals that occurred during the cluster study process, the
transmission provider must do the following: Within 30 calendar days of all
interconnection customers in the same cluster having: (1) withdrawn or been deemed
withdrawn; (2) executed an LGIA; or (3) requested an LGIA to be filed unexecuted,
determine if, and to what extent, any interconnection customers qualify to have their
increased network upgrade costs offset by withdrawal penalty funds and provide such
interconnection customers with an amended LGIA that provides the reduction in network
upgrade cost assignment and associated reduction to the interconnection customer’s
financial security requirements.
To account for withdrawals that occurred in the same cluster after the withdrawing
interconnection customer executed an LGIA, or requests the filing of an unexecuted
LGIA, the transmission provider must do the following: Within 30 calendar days of such
withdrawal or termination, determine if, and to what extent, any interconnection
customers qualify to have their increased network upgrade costs offset by withdrawal
penalty funds and provide such interconnection customers with an amended LGIA that
provides the reduction in network upgrade cost assignment and associated reduction to
the interconnection customer’s financial security requirements.
For any given withdrawal, if the transmission provider determines that there are no
network upgrade cost assignments in the withdrawn interconnection customer’s cluster

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 524 -

shared with the withdrawn interconnection customer, or if the transmission provider
determines that the withdrawn interconnection customer’s withdrawal did not cause a net
increase in the shared cost assignment for any remaining interconnection customers in the
cluster, the transmission provider must return the remaining withdrawal penalty to the
withdrawn interconnection customer. Such remaining withdrawal penalties will be
returned to withdrawn interconnection customers based on the proportion of each
withdrawn interconnection customer’s contribution to the total amount of withdrawal
penalty funds collected for the cluster. The transmission provider must make such
disbursement within 60 calendar days of the date on which all interconnection customers
in the same cluster have either (1) withdrawn or been deemed withdrawn; (2) executed an
LGIA; or (3) requested an LGIA to be filed unexecuted.
By way of example, assume that the transmission provider’s proportional impact
method identifies that interconnection customers A, B, and C in the same cluster all
contribute to the need for system network upgrade A, estimated at $40 million, in the
proportions of 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively. Interconnection customer C withdraws
from the interconnection queue after the facilities study, but before executing, or
requesting the unexecuted filing of, the LGIA and pays a withdrawal penalty of $1
million.1519 System network upgrade A is still required for interconnection customers A

1519

In this example, interconnection customer C paid a $1 million withdrawal
penalty because it was allocated $10 million in network upgrade cost (i.e., 25% of $40
million) and withdrew after receiving the facilities study report, at which point the
withdrawal penalty is 10% of the amount of network upgrades allocated to the
interconnection customer.

and B, and when the transmission provider conducts the proportional impact method in
the cluster restudy for the same cluster, it now determines that interconnection customer
A’s revised network upgrade cost allocation for system network upgrade A would
increase to 67% and interconnection customer B’s revised network upgrade cost
allocation for system network upgrade A would increase to approximately 33%. The
transmission provider would base the distribution of this interconnection customer’s
withdrawal penalty on the proportional impact analysis and credit 67% of the $1 million
to interconnection customer A and 33% to interconnection customer B.
Finally, section 3.7.1.2.5 of the pro forma LGIP provides that if, after the first and
second distribution steps are complete, some or all of an interconnection customer’s
withdrawal penalty remains, the transmission provider must return the balance of the
withdrawn interconnection customer’s withdrawal penalty funds to the withdrawn
interconnection customer.
In response to commenter’s concerns regarding the ability of transmission
providers to collect withdrawal penalties from interconnection customers,1520 we further
clarify that, in addition to study deposits, transmission providers must apply commercial
readiness deposits received from the interconnection customer that exceed the costs that
the transmission provider has incurred, including interest calculated in accordance with

section 35.19a(a)(2) of the Commission’s regulations, toward any withdrawal penalties
assessed to the interconnection customer, in accordance with pro forma LGIP section 3.7.
In response to NV Energy and Invenergy, we clarify that an interconnection
customer that withdraws during any time in the interconnection process is responsible for
the applicable withdrawal penalty as well as the costs incurred to perform studies up to
that point, and withdrawal penalty amounts will not be applied toward incurred study
costs. Additionally, in response to NV Energy, we clarify that if any portion of a
generating facility proposed in an interconnection request achieves commercial operation,
even if less than the original requested MW amount, the interconnection customer will
not be subject to withdrawal penalties.
In response to Tri-State, we clarify that the phrase “regardless of any previous
Withdrawal Penalty revenues received” in pro forma LGIP section 3.7.1.1 means that the
withdrawal penalty will be calculated based on actual study costs and will exclude any
credits to the study costs from penalties assessed to and received from other
interconnection customers.
We disagree with commenters that assert that a technical conference is needed to
further develop the record on withdrawal penalties before finalizing requirements in this
final rule. For the reasons explained above, we believe that the record supports the
reforms that we adopt herein and that their adoption is needed to ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and
timely manner.

Transition Process
a.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to establish a transition process for moving to a first-ready, firstserved cluster study process.1521 Specifically, the Commission proposed to require
transmission providers to offer existing, eligible interconnection customers the options to
either enter a transitional serial interconnection facilities study or a transitional cluster
study,1522 with commercial readiness requirements, or withdraw from the interconnection
queue without penalty.
To proceed to the transitional serial study, the Commission proposed that eligible
interconnection customers (i.e., interconnection customers that have executed a facilities
study agreement before the effective date of the transmission provider’s compliance
filing) would execute a transitional serial interconnection facilities study agreement to
codify their choice.1523 The Commission proposed that at the time of execution of such
agreement, the interconnection customer would be required to provide a deposit equal to
100% of the interconnection facility and network upgrade costs allocated to the

In the NOPR, the Commission explained that the transmission provider would
consider all interconnection requests accepted within a standard cluster study request
period have equal queue priority for purposes of the cluster study. See id. P 67. This
would be true for all interconnection requests accepted for the transitional cluster study as
well, per the NOPR.

interconnection customer in the system impact study report. The Commission explained
that if the interconnection customer’s proposed generating facility reaches commercial
operation, this deposit would be used toward construction costs of the same facilities.
The Commission further explained that if the interconnection customer withdraws,
the deposit would be refunded after the final invoice for study costs and the withdrawal
penalty are settled. The Commission proposed that the transitional serial study
withdrawal penalty would equal nine times the study cost. The Commission also
proposed that transitional serial generating facilities would be required to provide
evidence of exclusive site control for the entire generating facility and any
interconnection customer’s interconnection facilities, as well as demonstrate commercial
readiness through one of the following: (1) an executed term sheet (or comparable
evidence) related to a contract for the sale of the generating facility’s output or its
energy/ancillary services; (2) reasonable evidence that the generating facility is included
in a resource planning entity’s resource plan, has received a contract via a resource
solicitation process, or is being developed for a large end-use customer; or (3) a
provisional LGIA that is not suspended and includes a commitment to build the
generating facility. The Commission proposed that the deadline for the interconnection
customer to meet all the provisions above would be 60 calendar days after the effective
date of a transmission provider’s compliance filing to the final rule. Finally, the

Commission proposed that the transmission provider complete transitional serial studies
within 90 calendar days after the deadline for eligibility requirements to be satisfied.1524
The Commission proposed that existing interconnection customers that opt for the
transitional cluster study would execute a transitional cluster study agreement to codify
their choice.1525 The Commission proposed that interconnection customers may make a
one-time extension of their requested commercial operation date upon entry into the
transitional cluster study, where any such extension shall not result in a commercial
operation date later than December 31, 2027. The Commission proposed that the costs of
this study and the identified facilities would be allocated as the costs are allocated for
future cluster studies, as set forth in this final rule. The Commission also proposed that
the transitional cluster would be subject to an expedited combined system impact and
interconnection facilities study. The Commission explained that transitional cluster study
generating facilities would be required to select ERIS or NRIS. The Commission
proposed to require interconnection customers opting for a transitional cluster study to
make a $5 million deposit. The Commission proposed to subject this deposit to the same
conditions as the transitional serial study deposit.
The Commission also proposed to require interconnection customers with
interconnection requests in the transitional cluster to produce evidence of exclusive site
control for their entire generating facilities and demonstrate commercial readiness

The Commission proposed that the deadline to satisfy these requirements would be 60
calendar days after the effective date of a transmission provider’s compliance filing to the
final rule. Finally, the Commission proposed that the transitional cluster study be
completed by the transmission provider within 300 calendar days after the deadline for
eligibility requirements to be satisfied.
The Commission sought comment on: (1) whether certain interconnection
customers with pending interconnection requests submitted prior to the issuance of a final
rule should be allowed to proceed to LGIA execution without entering the transition
process; (2) whether the Commission should require transmission providers to accept any
additional commercial readiness demonstrations for entry into the transition process, and
whether existing interconnection customers should be permitted to enter their
interconnection requests into the transitional cluster study process by posting a deposit in
lieu of demonstrating commercial readiness; and (3) whether $5 million is a reasonable
estimate of the costs that would be allocated to the interconnection customer via the
transitional cluster study.1527

Comments in Support

A few commenters fully support the proposed transition process.1528 For example,
NRECA states that it strongly supports the proposed transition process because it fulfills
the Commission’s goal of ensuring an efficient way to prioritize and process
interconnection requests, based on how far they have advanced through the
interconnection process and their commercial readiness.1529
More commenters support the NOPR’s core proposal to require transmission
providers to offer interconnection customers with existing interconnection requests three
options for moving forward (i.e., entering a transitional serial study, entering a
transitional cluster study, or withdrawing without penalty).1530 For example, Pine Gate
asserts that, given the current interconnection queue backlogs in multiple regions, it is
essential that the Commission craft a transition process that permits late-stage
interconnection requests to finish the interconnection process under the existing rules,
while transitioning most interconnection requests to the new cluster study process.1531

With respect to the transitional serial study,1532 many commenters, predominantly
interconnection customers, support the proposal to provide this option to interconnection
customers that have executed a facilities study agreement.1533 AEE and Pine Gate state
that this provision respects the investments made by interconnection customers based on
current interconnection procedures.1534 Similarly, Pattern Energy argues that, at the
facilities study stage, an interconnection customer has relatively concrete economic
expectations about its potential network upgrade obligations and should not be required
to start the interconnection process over again.1535
Other commenters express qualified support for the proposal. Noting that
significant investments have been made and that generating facility contracting and
financing patterns have been developed based on existing tariffs, Interwest calls for a

1532

Note that most commenters refer to this as “proceeding to LGIA” or
“proceeding to LGIA without going through the transition process,” while a few use the
term “transitional serial study.” These terms are taken to be synonymous because the
NOPR describes the transitional serial study process as permitting interconnection
customers to “continue under the existing serial study process, enter into an LGIA, and
interconnect.” See NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 158.

structured, well-noticed transition period, to allow the market sufficient time to adjust to
new processes, especially if the new process dramatically alters interconnection and cost
allocation principles.1536 Similarly, the Pennsylvania Commission agrees that a transition
process is necessary to integrate the Commission’s proposed interconnection queue
reforms to allow individual interconnection customers the opportunity to decide, based on
the newly adopted minimum interconnection parameters, whether to remain in the
interconnection queue.1537

Comments in Opposition

CREA and NewSun argue that the proposed transition process is unnecessary, as a
first-ready, first-served cluster study process places the decision to enter a cluster in the
hands of the interconnection customer regardless of whether there are previously queued
interconnection requests.1538 In a similar vein, EEI contends that it would be reasonable
to require transmission providers to establish their own transition processes or to allow
existing interconnection customers to proceed to LGIA execution without entering the
transition process.1539
CREA and NewSun also fault the proposal to treat all interconnection requests in a
transitional cluster as having a single queue priority because it fails to protect the

investment expectations of interconnection customers with interconnection requests that
have entered the interconnection queue.1540 CREA and NewSun argue that the
Commission has previously recognized that queue positions should be respected and
either grandfathered or otherwise transitioned into a cluster study process that avoids
devaluing the existing queue position. CREA and NewSun urge the Commission to
modify its proposed cluster study process so that higher-queued interconnection requests
are given a higher-priority than lower-queued interconnection requests. CREA and
NewSun explain that this has worked in CAISO and Bonneville, which they assert uses a
similar mechanism to respect queue positions in its transmission planning expansion
process.
Shell requests that the Commission let existing processes continue for all
interconnection customers that have executed a system impact study agreement or cluster
study agreement because such processes, while not perfect, are functioning “well
enough.”1541 Illinois Commission expresses more general concern about the time
required for a transition process to be completed, noting that PJM’s transition process for
a recent set of interconnection queue reforms is expected to result in significant
delays.1542 Such delays, Illinois Commission contends, could prompt withdrawals and
less-than-optimal use of potential new resources, which in turn would undermine state

public policy goals and potentially threaten reliability. Longroad Energy similarly
recommends that the Commission seek to avoid creating a situation whereby a
transmission provider is forced to institute a pause on reviewing interconnection requests,
similar to PJM’s recent proposal to halt its review of interconnection requests for a twoyear period.1543

Comments on Specific Proposal
(a)

Serial Study Eligibility and Transition
Process Exceptions

Numerous commenters express support for one or more of the eligibility
requirements proposed in the NOPR. To proceed with a transitional serial study,
Affected Interconnection Customers agree that interconnection customers should provide
evidence of exclusive site control, demonstrate commercial readiness, and fund 100% of
their interconnection facility and network upgrade costs upfront.1544 Affected
Interconnection Customers reason that delays in processing interconnection requests
occur if speculative interconnection requests without adequate funding are allowed to
enter and clog the serial study process, only to drop out later and cause the need for
restudies.
However, Bonneville, PJM, OPSI, RWE Renewables, and NextEra express
concern that offering interconnection customers a serial study option may be

inefficient.1545 Bonneville states that it has received 52 interconnection requests, totaling
33 GW, in the 90 days since the NOPR’s issuance, and that completing existing studies
under the current process could delay Bonneville’s ability to implement a new cluster
study process, thus diminishing its near-term benefits.1546 OPSI calls for the Commission
to analyze whether this option could materially delay the transition process, and if so,
consider using a cluster study process as soon as feasible in the transition.1547 Similarly,
RWE Renewables assert that all parties should already be on notice about the pending
changes, allowing for swifter movement to new processes, particularly for those that have
not yet had any studies completed.1548 NextEra argues that it is best for all
interconnection customers at the same stage in the interconnection process to abide by the
same transition rules rather than giving them a choice between a serial or cluster study
process.1549
Several commenters suggest broadening opportunities for a transitional serial
study and/or exempting certain interconnection requests from transitional study. AEE,
Clean Energy Associations, and Pine Gate support allowing interconnection requests with

an executed or unexecuted facilities study agreement to proceed with a serial study.1550
Clean Energy Associations propose serial study eligibility for any interconnection request
that has a system impact study underway, provided the interconnection customer can
meet commercial readiness demonstration and deposit requirements on par with what
would be required at the equivalent stage of the standard cluster study process.1551
ENGIE supports a process that exempts interconnection requests with interconnection
costs of $5 million or less from a transitional study.1552 ENGIE also proposes that
interconnection requests that do not contribute to the need for network upgrades and/or
do not need facilities studies be permitted to proceed to an LGIA early.
Cypress Creek suggests that eligibility for a transitional serial study1553 be based
on: (1) a specified interconnection queue window developed through a stakeholder
process that extends to late stage interconnection requests; and (2) an objective
assessment of the plotted distribution of total network upgrades (in terms of millions of
dollars) to which the candidate interconnection request contributes, such that the total
number of interconnection requests eligible for transitional serial and transitional cluster

studies is known so transitional studies can be completed by a reasonable deadline.1554
Cypress Creek states that the distribution curve of network upgrades will help support
eligibility to those interconnection requests on the lower half of impacts. Finally,
Cypress Creek suggests that the Commission establish a date by which the transitional
serial process would conclude, and by which the transitional cluster process would begin.
Following these transitional studies, Cypress Creek recommends that the new cluster
study process commence, in lieu of the second transitional cluster proposed by the
Commission. Cypress Creek argues that this more rapid transition process better
balances interconnection rights of late-stage interconnection requests with the need to
move to the new process compared to the proposed transition process.

New Requirements on Existing
Interconnection Customers

AEE, Invenergy, NESCOE, and Shell argue that it is wrong, or could be unfairly
burdensome, to impose significant new requirements on interconnection customers that
have entered and proceeded through the interconnection queue in good faith.1555
Invenergy adds that this is especially true of interconnection customers that may have

entered the interconnection queue years before the NOPR was issued.1556 Other
commenters make similar points.1557
AEE and EDF Renewables stress the importance of not disrupting or further
delaying interconnection requests that are well along in the interconnection process.1558
ACE-NY states, more broadly, that interconnection requests currently in serial
interconnection queues should not be unduly harmed, adding that any transition process
should not delay the commercial operation date of existing and future generating
facilities.1559
Clean Energy Associations argue that transition interconnection customers,
whether they be in the serial or cluster study process, should not be held to higher
standards than those interconnection customers that would proceed with the regular
cluster study process unless the transition process leads to an LGIA and includes only
ready interconnection requests that have been delayed in the existing interconnection

requirements on existing interconnection customers.1561
(c)

Deposits

Several commenters object to the proposal to require that interconnection
customers, at the time of execution of the transitional serial study agreement, provide a
deposit equal to 100% of the interconnection facility and network upgrade costs allocated
to them in the system impact study report.1562 AEE and EDF Renewables argue that the
costs assigned at the system impact study stage often vary significantly from the network
upgrade costs provided at the facilities study stage.1563 EDF Renewables also argue that
the NOPR proposal is inconsistent with Order No. 2003, which specifically rejected such
a proposal in favor of requiring security for discrete portions of these costs.1564 EDF
Renewables adds that requiring a full deposit imposes a real cost on interconnection
customers, which typically obtain a letter of credit from a bank.

Likewise, several commenters object to the proposal to require a $5 million
deposit to proceed to the transitional cluster study.1565 Most of these commenters claim
that $5 million dollars is excessive and/or arbitrary;1566 fails to reflect the relative impact
of smaller proposed generating facilities;1567 likely is not indicative of costs across all
markets;1568 and will prompt otherwise viable interconnection requests to withdraw.1569
With respect to the NOPR’s reliance on PSCo’s claim that $5 million is within the range
of interconnection costs on its system, CREA and NewSun question whether PSCo
intended the deposit to serve as a barrier to its competitors in the generation market.1570
CREA and NewSun note that the three orders cited by the Commission in the NOPR
mention a $5 million deposit, but none provide a reasoned decision for acceptance of this

costs that may ultimately be allocated to interconnection customers.1572
AEE, Invenergy, and Pine Gate recommend that the deposit for either the
transitional serial facilities study agreement or transitional cluster study agreement reflect
a percentage of the network upgrade costs allocated to the interconnection customer, with
Invenergy recommending 20%.1573 Northwest and Intermountain and Xcel recommend
that the final rule require transmission providers to propose a deposit amount for
transitional studies that is appropriate to their interconnection queue and their specific
system configurations.1574 Xcel suggests that the Commission should accept proposals
that use an average of actual historical estimates of costs allocated to interconnection
customers with executed LGIAs to determine the security required to enter the
transitional cluster.1575

Commercial Readiness and Site Control

Idaho Power and Xcel emphasize the importance of requiring a commercial
readiness demonstration to enter the transition process.1576 Xcel argues that if a readiness
demonstration is not required, unready interconnection requests may be in the study
models for more than three years after they execute an LGIA and when they ultimately
withdraw, which will cause delays and cascading restudies.1577 Idaho Power asserts that
commercial readiness demonstrations for interconnection customers with executed
LGIAs are also critical, as their resource and network upgrades will need to be modeled
in the transitional cluster study.1578 NRECA proposes that interconnection customers that
show requisite site control and commercial readiness proceed to the “front of the line” as
“first-ready” in the transition cluster process without additional evaluation.1579 Both
Idaho Power and EEI recommend that interconnection customers with LGIAs, but that
have suspended interconnection-related construction, be required to meet the commercial
readiness requirements, with EEI also recommending that they be required to
demonstrate site control.1580

In addition to the proposed commercial readiness demonstration requirements,
Affected Interconnection Customers recommend that interconnection customers also be
allowed to provide evidence of (1) major equipment either contracted to purchase or
owned as part of an existing equipment fleet or (2) a completed engineering package
under provisional LGIAs.1581 SEIA recommends that interconnection customers be
allowed to demonstrate commercial readiness by providing a commitment to participate
in RTO/ISO markets or an application for a site permit.1582
A number of commenters oppose the NOPR’s proposed commercial readiness
requirements, as applied to the transition process.1583 SEIA states that the proposed
requirements will be nearly impossible for an independent power producer to meet and
ignore the very nature of a capacity market, which is to allow independent power
producers to sell capacity into a market.1584
Several commenters support allowing a deposit in lieu of demonstrating
commercial readiness, as applied to the transition process.1585 Pattern Energy argues for
this option to be available specifically for the transitional cluster study and recommends a

$5 million deposit value.1586 Pattern Energy claims that this would balance the need for
interconnection customers that may have been waiting for years to have their
interconnection requests studied with the need to transition to a new process. SEIA and
Pine Gate recommend that a commercial readiness deposit should be the norm, not the
exception, with SEIA also recommending that interconnection customers be required to
provide evidence of site control.1587 Pine Gate recommends a readiness deposit
framework that requires interconnection customers to make incrementally at-risk
payments throughout the interconnection process.1588
At the same time, several commenters oppose permitting deposits in lieu of
demonstrating commercial readiness, as applied to the transition process.1589 Ameren
calls such deposits “opportunities for delay” that will not facilitate the interconnection of
interconnection requests for which the interconnection customer has demonstrated
commercial readiness.1590 Idaho Power opposes the option because the transitional
cluster study is an expedited, combined system impact and interconnection facilities
study.1591 If the Commission does allow a deposit, EEI argues that the option should

Withdrawal Penalties

Many commenters oppose the NOPR’s proposed transition process withdrawal
penalties.1593 CREA and NewSun, Pine Gate, and Ørsted call the penalties harsh or
draconian.1594 Ørsted notes that offshore wind project interconnection customers with
contracts awarded via a state-sponsored resource solicitation process have already spent
tens of millions of dollars to secure leaseholds, conduct extensive geotechnical studies of
these lease areas, and engineering studies.1595 Given these investments, Ørsted contends
that the decision to withdraw from the interconnection queue is most likely going to be
based on some issue outside of the control of the interconnection customer, such as
supply chain constraints, and not because the interconnection request will not go forward
at some point.

AES states that withdrawal should be penalty-free if an interconnection customer
decides not to move forward with a proposed generating facility during the transition.1596
EDF Renewables asserts that a transition process should offer existing interconnection
customers an opportunity to exit the interconnection queue in line with what they
expected when entering.1597 SEIA recommends that the withdrawal penalty for
interconnection customers in the transitional cluster study be capped at the withdrawing

AES, CREA and NewSun, and Invenergy assert that the NOPR’s proposed 60-day

to put interconnection customers on notice of potential reforms, given that any aspect of
the NOPR could be modified in the final rule and be subject to variations in compliance
filings.1604 AES states that it does not oppose requiring interconnection customers to

In cases where the transition process is slow due to the sheer scale of change,
Illinois Commission calls for an accelerated process for interconnection requests that
allow states to ensure reliability and meet statutory obligations and public policy
objectives.1607 Illinois Commission adds that such a process could be accomplished in a
narrowly tailored manner and would be more efficient than allowing RTOs/ISOs an
extended period to clear out prior interconnection queue backlogs.
CREA and NewSun propose, and SEIA supports, a transitional cluster study

expedite interconnection study, eliminate excessive deposits and penalties, permit
withdrawals without penalty if no burden is imposed on other interconnection customers,
respect queue positions and associated investment expectations of queued interconnection
requests, and avoid “years of bottlenecks and market distorting problems” associated with
solutions based on readiness requirements.1609 CREA and NewSun state that this
proposed process draws on Bonneville, CAISO, and MISO’s current practices as

Southern notes that under proposed section 5.1.1.2(2) of the pro forma LGIP, the

volumes of interconnection requests in their interconnection queues.1614 For instance,
Duke Southeast Utilities references the Commission’s recognition that transmission
providers that already have a Commission-approved LGIP and LGIA based on a firstready, first-served cluster study process may not need another transition process. Duke
adds that requiring a second transition process would likely add confusion and potentially
result in waiver requests filed with the Commission.1615 ISO-NE states that New England
does not currently suffer interconnection queue backlogs to the same extent as other
regions, and transition provisions could have a significant impact on interconnection
requests that are currently proceeding through the existing interconnection process.1616

CAISO, Duke Southeast Utilities, and Invenergy call on the Commission to permit
transmission providers in regions that already use a first-ready, first-served cluster study
process to minimize or omit a transition process.1618 CAISO recommends that
transmission providers be permitted to propose just and reasonable effective dates for
each reform.1619 CAISO adds that it anticipates that most reforms should be effective
with the beginning of the next cluster study after a compliance filing is approved, but
some reforms could be implemented for existing interconnection requests in the queue,
especially for interconnection customers that may not have executed an LGIA.
Conversely, Tri-State states that a transition period will be necessary, even for those
transmission providers already employing a first-ready, first-served cluster study process,
due to changes beyond the overarching structure of the interconnection queue, such as a
requirement for 100% site control.1620

Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal to modify section 5 of the pro forma LGIP to
establish a transition process for moving to the first-ready, first-served cluster study
process adopted in this final rule from the existing first-come, first-served serial study
process. Specifically, we adopt the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
offer existing interconnection customers up to three transition options, depending on
which phase of the serial study process their interconnection requests are in: (1) a
transitional serial study comprised of a facilities study (i.e., a transitional serial
interconnection facilities study), (2) a transitional cluster study comprised of a clustered
system impact study and individual facilities studies, or (3) withdrawal from the
interconnection queue without penalty. We also adopt definitions for the reports issued
in association with options (1) and (2), respectively (i.e., a transitional serial
interconnection facilities study report and a transitional cluster study report). As
discussed below, regarding eligibility for the transitional serial study, we modify the

NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to offer the transitional serial study
option to interconnection customers that have been tendered a facilities study agreement,
even if they have not yet executed that agreement, as of 30 calendar days after the filing
date of the transmission provider’s initial filing to comply with this final rule. Similarly,
regarding eligibility for the transitional cluster study, we modify the NOPR proposal to
require transmission providers to offer the transitional cluster study option to
interconnection customers with an assigned queue position as of 30 calendar days after
the filing date of the transmission provider’s initial filing to comply with this final rule.
We also adopt the NOPR proposals for transition process deposits, withdrawal penalties,
and deadlines. We decline to adopt the proposal to impose a commercial readiness
demonstration requirement and adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal for site
control requirements.
We concur with commenters that, given current interconnection queue backlogs in
multiple regions, it is essential that the Commission craft a transition process. Doing so
will give interconnection customers, along with other market participants, time to adjust
to new processes and requirements. We note that many responsive commenters support
the proposed three options and, in particular, support providing interconnection
customers at the facilities study stage the option for a transitional serial study.1633 We

concur with NRECA that the NOPR’s proposed transition process will create an efficient
way to prioritize and process interconnection requests, based on how far they have
advanced through the interconnection process and their level of commercial readiness.
We further find that the transition process, as adopted herein, appropriately balances the
need to move expeditiously to the new cluster study process with the need to respect the
investments and expectations of interconnection customers at an advanced stage in the
existing interconnection process.1634
We disagree with commenters that contend that the NOPR’s proposed transition
process is unnecessary, should be optional, or poses an undue risk of delay. As stated in
the NOPR and affirmed in our findings in Section II of this final rule, we believe that
interconnection queue backlogs exist throughout the country, in part, because the pro
forma LGIP creates an incentive for interconnection customers to submit multiple
interconnection requests for a given potential generating facility and remain in the
interconnection queue to determine which of those interconnection requests has the
lowest costs to interconnect.1635 Given this, simply moving to the new cluster study
process, as CREA and NewSun suggest, risks creating large initial clusters, which may
prevent interconnection customers from being able to interconnect in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner. Similarly, if transmission providers only used serial
study processes to transition, it could put existing interconnection requests at greater risk

of cascading withdrawals that would delay the adoption of standard cluster study
processes. With respect to concerns that a transition process could introduce delays, we
note that the serial study portion of the transition process is limited to 90 calendar days,
after which point the transitional cluster study commences.
We decline requests to modify the proposed transitional cluster study process to
give higher-queued interconnection requests a higher queue position than lower-queued
interconnection requests. As stated above, to address the interconnection queue backlogs
that currently exist, it is necessary to move the bulk of existing interconnection requests
to the cluster study process, and as such, interconnection requests studied in the same
cluster have equal queue priority to avoid undue discrimination.
We also decline calls to modify the NOPR proposal to require that:
(1) interconnection customers electing the transitional serial study must provide a deposit
equal to 100% of the interconnection facility and network upgrade costs allocated to the
interconnection customer in the system impact study; and (2) interconnection customers
electing the transitional cluster study must provide a deposit equal to $5 million. As
noted earlier, the transition process is anticipated to involve more interconnection
customers than standard annual clusters (due to existing interconnection queue backlogs),
which greatly increases the risk of late-stage withdrawals. Adopting deposit
requirements for the transitional studies higher than those adopted for the cluster study
process will help to ensure that the transitional process is used by interconnection
customers that intend to proceed with their proposed generating facilities. In response to
arguments that the proposed deposit amounts are arbitrary and/or excessive, we note that

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 559 -

they are based on expected costs to the extent practicable and that only a portion of these
deposits are ultimately at-risk. That is, the withdrawal penalty is set at nine times the
study cost, as discussed below, with the remainder of deposits to be refunded.1636 We
also note that existing interconnection customers that are currently in an interconnection
queue can opt to withdraw their interconnection requests without penalty and wait for the
first standard cluster study with associated lower deposit requirements. Finally, with
respect to EDF Renewable’s claim that the transitional serial study deposit conflicts with
the Commission’s intentions in Order No. 2003, we find that the heightened need to
avoid late-stage withdrawals during the transition process—a need that the Commission
could not have anticipated in Order No. 2003—warrants the transitional use of this
requirement for the transitional serial study.
We adopt the NOPR proposal that the transitional study withdrawal penalty should
equal nine times the study cost. The withdrawal penalty plays an important role in
deterring speculative interconnection requests in both the standard cluster study and the
transition process. We disagree with commenters that call for a lower penalty to apply
during the transition process, given that the risk of withdrawals is heightened during the
transition process. With respect to Ørsted’s contention that offshore wind developers will
likely withdraw interconnection requests solely due to circumstances beyond their
control, we note that, regardless of the cause, a withdrawal may cause harm to other

1636

See supra Section III.A.7.a. Also, as one indicator of study costs, NV Energy
states that, on average, it spends between $80,000 and $100,000 between the clustered
system impact study and facilities studies. See supra Section III.A.6.a.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

- 560 -

interconnection customers in the transition process. Thus, we find it appropriate to
impose penalties on those that choose to withdraw notwithstanding that withdrawal may
at times be due to circumstances beyond the interconnection customer’s control.
Interconnection customers will bear the risk of withdrawal penalties and consider that
risk in deciding whether to elect to join a transition process.
We recognize that some transmission providers have existing cluster studies in
progress and others have Commission-approved transition plans in progress. We
emphasize that the provisions of this final rule are not intended to interfere with the
timely completion of those in-progress cluster studies and transition processes. With
respect to concerns about duplicative transition processes, we clarify that transmission
providers that have already adopted a cluster study process or are currently undergoing a
transition to a cluster study process will not be required to implement a new transition
process.
We are not persuaded by commenters’ requests to permit transmission providers to
establish their own transition plans. Transmission providers would likely require monthsto-years to develop and execute their own transition plans, given the need for stakeholder
dialogue and internal approval, followed by Commission review and approval. We find
that the benefits of moving forward with an efficient, standardized transition process
outweigh the potential benefits of relying on tailor-made transition processes developed
by each transmission provider and its stakeholders.
Likewise, we decline to adopt any of the alternatives put forth by commenters.
We are not persuaded by Shell’s proposal to allow transmission providers to “opt-out” of

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 561 -

the transition process based on their prior performance. We view the existing serial study
process as inherently more prone to cascading withdrawals and delays, and thus ill-suited
to a transition period intended to set the stage for a standard cluster study process. We
view the Illinois Commission’s proposal for an accelerated process (for interconnection
requests related to states’ objectives) in regions that may propose a lengthier transition
process timeline, as more appropriately addressed by transmission providers in individual
compliance filings. And, given the need for even more stringent requirements in a
transition process discussed earlier, we view CREA and NewSun’s proposal to use
progressively increasing deposits, during a transition process, as inherently ill-suited to
address major interconnection queue backlogs.
Finally, we decline calls to modify the NOPR proposal to require interconnection
customers to meet transitional serial study eligibility requirements in 60 days after the
Commission-approved effective date of a transmission provider’s filing in compliance
with this final rule. Given that we do not adopt the proposed commercial readiness
demonstration requirements, we find that the 60-calendar day deadline provides
interconnection customers with sufficient time to adjust to the new requirements, i.e., to
choose a transition option and, depending on the option chosen, demonstrate site control
and provide a deposit. Furthermore, we concur with NRECA that this period will be
augmented, in practice, by the 90-calendar day period afforded to transmission providers
to submit their compliance filings.1637

Transition Process Eligibility and Exceptions

As stated above, we modify the NOPR proposal regarding the eligibility for the
transitional serial study and transitional cluster study.1638 Any interconnection customer
that has been tendered a facilities study agreement as of 30 calendar days after the filing
date of the transmission provider’s initial filing to comply with this final rule (even if it
has not yet executed that agreement) may opt to proceed with a transitional serial study or
withdraw its interconnection request without penalty. Transmission providers are
required to tender an LGIA, pursuant to the requirements of section 11 of the pro forma
LGIP, to any interconnection customer that has received a final facilities study report
before the transmission provider commences transitional serial studies. Any
interconnection customer that has an assigned queue position as of 30 calendar days after
the filing date of the transmission provider’s initial filing to comply with this final rule
may opt to proceed with a transitional cluster study or withdraw its interconnection
request without penalty.
We find that an earlier eligibility cut-off for the transitional studies will allow the
transitional studies to begin sooner, which in turn, will allow transmission providers and
interconnection customers to benefit from the Commission’s new cluster study process
sooner. Further, we consider this modification appropriate because interconnection
customers will have 120 calendar days after the publication of this final rule in the
Federal Register to achieve eligibility for the transition process (90 calendar days for

1638

- 563 -

transmission providers to submit compliance filings, plus the 30-calendar day eligibility
cut-off).
Additionally, we modify the NOPR proposal to require the transmission provider
to tender the appropriate transitional study agreements (serial and/or cluster as
applicable) to eligible interconnection customers no later than the Commission-approved
effective date of the transmission provider’s compliance filing with this final rule. We
find that this requirement will help ensure that interconnection customers are informed
about their eligibility for the transitional studies (including the associated requirements
and deadlines) in a timely manner.
Transmission providers are not required to tender transitional study agreements to
interconnection customers that submit an interconnection request after the 30-calendar
day eligibility cut-off described above. Interconnection customers that submit an
interconnection request after the 30-calendar day eligibility cut-off will be required to pay
for any studies conducted by the transmission provider under its existing tariff (as
required by pro forma LGIP section 13.3), and their interconnection requests will not be
allowed to enter the transition process, although they may enter their interconnection
requests in the transmission provider’s first standard cluster study, provided that they
meet the new requirements for interconnection requests by the close of the first cluster
request window.
We are persuaded by commenters’ suggestion to require transmission providers to
offer the transitional serial study option to interconnection customers that have been
tendered a facilities study agreement, even if they have not yet executed that agreement,

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 564 -

as of 30 calendar days after the filing date of the transmission provider’s initial filing to
comply with this final rule, and we modify the NOPR proposal accordingly. We find that
interconnection requests at this point in the interconnection process are at an equivalent
point as those interconnection requests for which interconnection customers have
executed a facilities study agreement, as in both cases, the transmission provider has
completed the system impact study but has not yet commenced the facilities study. We
are not persuaded by commenters to extend the option for transitional serial study to
interconnection requests at earlier stages in the interconnection process, as such
modifications may undermine the ability of the proposed reforms to accelerate
interconnection queue processing and could delay the transition to the new, more
efficient cluster study process. We disagree with the proposal to exempt from the
transition process interconnection requests that appear, based on a feasibility study, to
require limited or no network upgrades. The results of this feasibility study may no
longer be accurate depending on which higher-queued interconnection customers remain
in the interconnection queue after the transition date.
ii.

Commercial Readiness and Site Control

We decline to adopt the proposed commercial readiness demonstration options for
transitional studies for the same reasons that we are not adopting those options for cluster
studies going forward, as discussed above. We adopt with modification the NOPR’s
proposed site control requirements. Specifically, we require interconnection customers
electing a transitional study, regardless of whether they select the transitional serial study
or the transitional cluster study, to demonstrate 100% site control for their proposed

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

generating facilities. We find that such a requirement will provide further assurance that
such interconnection customers are ready to proceed to construction. We modify the
NOPR proposal by declining to require that interconnection customers that choose to
proceed with a transitional serial interconnection facilities study must also demonstrate
100% site control for any interconnection customer’s interconnection facilities because
such a requirement would be overly burdensome for interconnection customers, in
addition to the other requirements we are adopting elsewhere in this final rule. Further,
we find that this requirement is not needed to ensure that such interconnection customers
are ready to proceed to construction.

Tariff Language

We agree with Southern’s recommendation to align timelines for truing up
construction costs in the proposed pro forma LGIP section 5.1.1.2(2) and current,
unmodified by this final rule, pro forma LGIA article 12.2 (Final Invoice) by making
these provisions consistent at six months, and we modify the NOPR proposal
accordingly. We agree with Southern that consistent timelines for truing up construction
costs will provide clarity and certainty for interconnection customers.

Reforms to Increase the Speed of Interconnection Queue Processing
1.

Elimination of the Reasonable Efforts Standard
a.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

As the Commission explained in the NOPR, the pro forma LGIP does not require
transmission providers to meet deadlines for conducting interconnection studies.1639
Rather, transmission providers are only required to use “reasonable efforts” to complete
interconnection studies on time.1640 “Reasonable efforts” are defined as “actions that are
timely and consistent with Good Utility Practice and are substantially equivalent to those
a Party would use to protect its own interests.”1641 There are no explicit consequences in
the pro forma LGIP for transmission providers that fail to meet their study deadlines.
In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that the use of the reasonable
efforts standard for transmission providers to complete interconnection studies resulted in
Commission-jurisdictional rates that were unjust and unreasonable because: (1) the
timely provision of interconnection service was critical to maintaining just and
reasonable rates; (2) the data collected pursuant to Order No. 845 demonstrated that the
failure to timely complete interconnection studies was a significant nationwide problem,
even for transmission providers that had implemented other interconnection reforms; and
(3) the reasonable efforts standard did not provide a meaningful incentive for

transmission providers to complete their interconnection studies within the deadlines
established in their tariffs.1642
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to eliminate the
reasonable efforts standard for transmission providers completing interconnection studies
and instead impose firm study deadlines and establish penalties that would apply when
transmission providers fail to meet study deadlines.1643 Specifically, the Commission
proposed to require transmission providers that do not complete a cluster study, cluster
restudy, facilities study, or affected system study by the deadline specified in the pro
forma LGIP to pay a penalty of $500 per each business day that the study is late, except
in situations where force majeure applies. The Commission proposed that those penalties
would be distributed to the delayed interconnection customers on a pro rata basis to offset
their study costs. Consistent with other penalties, the Commission proposed that such
penalties would not be recoverable in transmission rates.1644
The Commission also proposed to cap penalties at 100% of the total study deposit
received for the late study to provide a safeguard against overly large penalties that may

be considered punitive.1645 The Commission further proposed that no financial penalties
on transmission providers that fail to meet study deadlines would be assessed until one
cluster study cycle (that is not a transitional study cycle) after the Commission-approved
effective date for implementing the reforms proposed in the NOPR. Additionally, the
Commission proposed a 10-business day grace period such that no penalties would be
assessed for a study that is delayed by 10 business days or less; for studies that are
delayed by more than 10 business days, the penalty would be calculated based on the first
business day the study was late. Further, the Commission proposed to permit the
transmission provider to extend the deadline for a particular study by 30 business days by
mutual agreement of the transmission provider and all interconnection customers in the
relevant study. Finally, the Commission proposed to require transmission providers to
post to their OASIS or a public website on a quarterly basis the total amount of such
penalties from the previous quarter and the highest amount of such penalties paid to a
single interconnection request from the previous quarter.
The Commission acknowledged that the application of penalties for late
interconnection studies in the context of RTOs/ISOs may raise several unique issues.1646
However, consistent with the Commission’s findings in Order No. 890,1647 the

Commission explained that penalties are appropriate in certain circumstances to
incentivize compliance with tariff deadlines, notwithstanding the RTO’s/ISO’s status as a
not-for-profit entity. To ensure that RTOs/ISOs would be able to pay any such penalties,
the Commission proposed to require RTOs/ISOs to propose tariff provisions that would
require the RTO/ISO to submit requests to recover the costs of specific interconnection
study penalties under FPA section 205. The Commission explained that, similar to the
ability of RTOs/ISOs to seek to directly assign monetary penalties for violations of
reliability standards to other responsible entities, RTOs/ISOs could include a provision
that the RTO/ISO may make an FPA section 205 filing seeking to allocate such penalties
to the appropriate transmission owner that is responsible for, or contributed to, the
delay.1648 However, the Commission sought comment on whether there was a more
appropriate method for assigning such penalties in RTOs/ISOs. More generally, the
Commission sought comment on whether penalties would effectively incentivize more
timely completion of interconnection studies in RTOs/ISOs, and/or whether monetary
penalties could have adverse consequences (e.g., compromising accuracy or increasing
waiver requests as transmission providers strive to meet deadlines).
Additionally, the Commission sought comment on: (1) the proposed penalty
structure, including whether the penalty amount for a cluster study should be $500 per

order on reh’g, Order No. 890-C, 126 FERC ¶ 61,228, order on clarification, Order

business day or whether an approach that accounts for the number of interconnection
customers affected, such as $100 per business day per customer in the delayed study,
would be more appropriate; (2) how and when the Commission should require
transmission providers to communicate to interconnection customers the status of studies
that may be delayed; (3) whether to include exceptions to the penalty other than force
majeure, and if so, what those exceptions should be; and (4) whether Commission staff
should issue periodic reports summarizing the status of transmission providers’
interconnection queues and timeliness of interconnection studies based on information
collected through existing reporting requirements, and whether this periodic report should
be in addition to or a substitute for the proposed monetary penalties discussed above.1649

affected systems studies.1676 NYISO states that its August 2022 Order No. 845 report,
and other recent RTO/ISO reports, detail the various drivers of delays, which are
typically outside their control.1677 NYISO argues that it would not be reasoned decisionmaking for the Commission to ignore these reports and draw an overly simplistic

Several commenters who oppose the NOPR proposal assert that transmission

transmission providers already have sufficient motivation to process the interconnection
queue in a timely manner because: (1) their own interconnection requests are processed
in the exact same manner as third parties; (2) they need to ensure an adequate amount of
generation to meet load and reserve margin requirements; and (3) they have to file reports
with the Commission and can face complaints or enforcement action for poor
performance.1685 Commenters assert that penalties will be ineffective in speeding

remain.1686 MISO TOs contend that the Commission proposes to compound the problem
of study delays by requiring transmission owners and providers to manage delays that are
out of their control, while simultaneously proposing to require transmission providers to
offer additional studies.1687
NextEra argues that penalties will be counterproductive if not paired with
constructive guidance to transmission providers on how to perform interconnection
studies in a timelier manner because penalties could either divert resources away from
interconnection studies and lead to conflict about allocating penalties in RTOs/ISOs or be
accepted as a cost of doing business.1688

Some commenters argue that the NOPR proposal is an unsupported shift from
recent precedent.1690 Commenters note that the Commission expressly declined to
impose penalties for study delays in Order No. 845 and argue that there is no change in
circumstance or concrete evidence to justify reversal of that prior finding.1691
Commenters also note that, although the Commission based its penalty proposal
on Order No. 890, there are significant differences.1692 First, commenters explain that the
Order No. 890 penalties only apply when a transmission provider fails to meet multiple
study deadlines, whereas the NOPR proposes to impose penalties each time a study

structure protects due process through an opportunity to present evidence that delays
were outside the transmission provider’s control or due to extenuating circumstances,
whereas the NOPR proposal does not.1694 Third, PacifiCorp explains that interconnection
studies are more complex, numerous, and susceptible to delays than the transmission

service studies at issue in Order No. 890.1695 Affected Interconnection Customers argue
that the Commission’s comparison to Order No. 890’s penalty structure for transmission
service requests is misplaced because the size and scale of the current interconnection
queue backlog is significantly different than transmission queues when Order No. 890
was issued.1696 Similarly, Invenergy notes that the reference to transmission service
requests is inapplicable because the interconnection process uses a cluster study.1697
EEI and Eversource state that the NOPR proposal represents a departure from the
good utility practice standard, which the Commission uses in many other contexts and is
part of the definition of reasonable efforts.1698 EEI and Eversource assert that the
Commission has not adequately explained why reliance on good utility practice remains
sufficient in other situations, but not for interconnection studies.
Commenters contend that firm study deadlines are not reasonable or feasible
because interconnection studies are complex and each study is different in scope, size,
and needed coordination.1699 Some commenters also note that the current deadlines were

interconnection requests to study.1700 SPP contends that cluster studies are more prone to
study delays given the interdependencies between interconnection requests and number
of parties that need to cooperate.1701 Commenters also assert that the other NOPR
proposals, including the optional resource solicitation study, informational studies, and
evaluation of advanced transmission technologies, add significant burdens to the study
process that will make it even more challenging to comply with strict deadlines.1702
Some commenters express concern that the penalties could reduce coordination
between transmission providers, interconnection customers, and affected systems.1703

deficiencies or modify interconnection requests.1705 MISO TOs assert that this could
threaten reliability.1706 NESCOE points out that firm penalties may impede the
interconnection of emerging technologies by limiting flexibility to work on modeling and
data requirements.1707
PJM argues that using penalties to offset study costs for interconnection customers
introduces perverse incentives for the interconnection customer to dispute and thereby
delay its study reports to receive the penalty money.1708 In response, however, AEE notes
that interconnection customers bear greater costs due to delays, which creates an
incentive to move forward as quickly as possible.1709
Commenters note that the same engineers that conduct interconnection studies also
have other responsibilities such as transmission planning1710 and responding to extreme

difficult to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform the studies.1713
A number of commenters express concern that the NOPR proposal may result in

could also lead to inaccurate results and cause restudy.1716 Some commenters state that
less accurate studies would harm interconnection customers because interconnection
customers cannot rely on them to make sound business decisions.1717 Avangrid states
that transmission providers could use more conservative assumptions and “stock
solutions” to streamline studies, which could increase interconnection costs.1718
However, in response to these comments, AEE states that the implementation of
timelines and penalties does not inherently determine the evaluation process for
clusters.1719 AEE notes that inaccurate study results occur today without firm deadlines
and that accuracy can be improved even with deadlines.1720 New Jersey Commission
disagrees that there is an inherent tradeoff between system reliability and holding
transmission providers accountable, arguing that failing to bring sufficient new
generating facilities online can create considerable reliability and economic risks.1721

Commenters express concern that the cost of penalties and compliance
mechanisms may be passed down to customers and increase transmission costs.1722 Clean
Energy Buyers argue that the penalties, if they flow through to interconnection
customers, could outweigh the benefits gained from other reforms and lead to disputes
over the allocation of penalty amounts.1723 R Street points out that the Commission will
have to ensure that transmission providers cannot translate penalties into cost recovery at
either the federal or retail level.1724
Some commenters characterize the NOPR proposal as a strict liability approach to
penalties and argue that it is unjust and unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, and a
violation of due process rights and the Administrative Procedures Act to impose penalties
without a fact-based finding of fault.1725 Some commenters emphasize that the NOPR
proposal provides no possibility for the transmission provider to explain the
circumstances for the delay, even though the delay is often outside of the transmission

NOPR proposal: (1) how disputes about who is at fault will be resolved; (2) who decides
fault; and (3) whether the interconnection study should be delayed while the dispute is
resolved.1727
Some commenters argue that the reasonable efforts standard is the right approach
considering the complex dynamics of the interconnection study process and constantly
changing circumstances.1728 EEI asserts that the reasonable efforts standard is the best
approach to govern the interconnection process, which is flexible to allow for the
optimum exercise of engineering judgement while ensuring accountability for egregious
delays or what is not consistent with good utility practice.1729 MISO TOs note that, in
Order No. 2003, the Commission explained that the reasonable efforts standard was a
high standard because parties use it when protecting their own interests and applying this
standard to all parties would “ensure comparable treatment.”1730

NYISO contends that the reasonable efforts standard and Order No. 845 reporting
requirements provide the Commission and stakeholders with information to evaluate the
length of time taken by RTOs/ISOs to finish studies, compare their performance, and
identify and investigate when a particular entity is systematically delaying studies, which
will allow the Commission and stakeholders to take appropriate action.1731 SPP proposes
that the Commission retain the reasonable efforts standard and make improvements to it
or enforce it more strictly.1732
WAPA notes that, as a federal power marketing administration, it has statutory
duties that take precedence over deliverables established by the Commission and cannot
be subject to monetary penalties without a waiver of sovereign immunity.1733 Avangrid
notes that many transmission providers and transmission owners do not earn rates of
return for interconnection facilities or network upgrades and do not profit from
interconnection studies, so penalties would reduce shareholder return on equity.1734

simply prohibit late studies and mandate firm study deadlines because the proposed

as described below, have various comments on the specific penalty proposal.
(a)

Penalty Amount

Some commenters advocate for larger penalties than the NOPR proposal.1738
Some commenters contend that the proposed penalty amount is de minimis1739 or that a
$500 per business day penalty is likely too small to prompt a change in behavior.1740

contractual deadlines.1741 ACE-NY proposes a penalty of $5,000 to $25,000 per day,
depending on cluster size, if the Commission chooses a per-cluster-per-day penalty
structure.1742 Affected Interconnection Customers propose that the Commission adopt a
penalty of $2,500 per day capped at $2 million.1743 Public Interest Organizations state
that there is not sufficient consensus in the record to move forward with the $500 per day
penalty amount and suggest that the Commission hold a technical conference to
determine the final amount.1744
Some commenters argue that the penalties should increase through the study
process because later-stage study delays have greater impacts on interconnection
customers, which are required to make increasing commitments throughout the study
process.1745 Invenergy recommends penalty amounts of $5,000 per day for cluster
studies, $6,000 per day for cluster restudies, and $7,000 per day for facilities studies.1746
Pine Gate expresses concern that the proposed penalty amounts do not correspond
to the costs imposed on interconnection customers as a result of the late study results,

explaining that the penalty amount is dwarfed by the overall cluster study cost and that
the low daily rate would require an interconnection study to be delayed years before the
amounts would approach the study deposit amounts.1747 As an example, Pine Gate refers
to the most recent MISO interconnection queue submissions: MISO received 956
interconnection requests, totaling 170.8 GW of new generation, and collected
$687,980,000 in study deposits. Pine Gate notes that, under a late study fee of $500 per
day, a study would have to be delayed 1,375,960 days—or 3,770 years—before equaling
the cost of study deposits. Further, Pine Gate explains that the daily carrying cost on the
study deposit cost at the prevailing development loan interest rate of 10% is
approximately $188,487.67. Thus, Pine Gate states that, before the proposed 10-day
grace period has elapsed, interconnection customers will have spent $1,884,876 in
additional interest costs.
In response to requests for higher penalties, some commenters argue that there is
no legal or policy justification for making the proposed penalty scheme harsher and more
inequitable.1748 MISO argues that NERC reliability penalties are typically assessed at
under $500 per day, if at all, and NERC non-critical infrastructure protection penalties
are also assessed at far lower values. MISO contends that, because these “moderate risk”

violations merit such low penalties, there is no support for $500 per day penalties for
delayed interconnection studies.1749
NARUC supports the proposal to cap the penalty amount at 100% of the total
study deposit received.1750 Several commenters argue that the penalty amount should be
capped at an amount greater than 100% of the total study deposit received.1751 Invenergy
requests that the Commission clarify that the cap is not reduced by any withdrawal
penalties.1752 Public Interest Organizations propose that transmission providers that reach
the cap issue a compliance statement explaining in detail the source of the delay and use
penalty amounts above the cap to hire third-party consultants to conduct interconnection
studies.1753
Several commenters argue that the penalty amount should not be capped.1754

Penalty Structure

Some commenters suggest a per-customer per-day penalty structure, rather than
the NOPR proposal for a per-cluster per-day structure.1757 AEE suggests that the
Commission assess penalties based on the higher value of $500 per day or $100 per
customer per day.1758 Multiple commenters oppose a penalty structure based on the
number of interconnection customers because transmission providers have no control
over the number of interconnection requests they receive and higher request volumes lead
to more complex studies with more potential for delay.1759
Some commenters suggest a penalty structure based on the cluster’s
characteristics.1760 Public Interest Organizations suggest a penalty structure set as a

percentage of the total study deposit received per day.1761 Google recommends the
penalty structure take into account both the size of the interconnection request and the
magnitude of a study delay’s impact on other interconnection requests in the
interconnection queue, which would focus penalties on delays that have the most impact
on overall processing of the interconnection queue.1762 NARUC explains that the penalty
should not be targeted at the number of interconnection customers in a cluster that are
delayed but at the desirable characteristics of the generating facilities being delayed.1763
Some commenters suggest that the Commission require transmission providers to
discount study costs for delayed studies by the percentage of time they are delayed in
completing such study, subject to a maximum discount set by the Commission.1764 Clean
Energy States propose that, if an interconnection study is late, the transmission provider
could not charge the interconnection customers for the cost of the study, providing the
interconnection customer a modest amount of compensation for the delay.1765 PacifiCorp

by transmission providers that are not public utilities.1766
NRECA and Tri-State assert that the final rule should allow transmission
providers to stop or reset the clock in the event of interconnection customer-initiated
delays.1767 Similarly, APPA-LPPC state that the clock should not start running on study
deadlines until after the interconnection customer submits all necessary information,
including curing any deficiencies.1768 Tri-State asserts that a delay should not be
penalized if it is caused by a higher-queued cluster going through a restudy.1769 Tri-State
also suggests that, if the Commission moves forward with penalties for late studies,
additional language should be added requiring interconnection customers to provide
needed information within a specified time frame in order to complete the studies. R

such as by forcing requesting parties to resubmit specifications to restart the processing

Many commenters agree that transmission providers, including RTOs/ISOs, must
not pass on penalty costs to ratepayers.1771 Public Interest Organizations support enabling
transmission providers to allocate penalty costs to responsible parties but recommend
maintaining presumption of fault with the transmission providers themselves and
disallowing transmission providers from recovering penalty amounts.1772
Several commenters support distributing the penalties collected from transmission
providers to the impacted interconnection customers.1773 PG&E seeks clarification on
how the penalty would be distributed (i.e., equal distribution to each interconnection
customers, equal distribution among interconnection requests, or distributed based on
project size).1774 Fervo Energy supports the proposal to require transmission providers to

Penalty Recovery in RTOs/ISOs

Some commenters support the proposal to allow RTOs/ISOs to recover the cost of
specific interconnection study penalties from transmission owners responsible for study
delays through FPA section 205 filings.1778 ACORE recommends that RTOs/ISOs
provide explicit criteria for how they will determine which parties are responsible for or
contributed to study delays.1779 AEE suggests that the Commission assign RTO/ISO
penalties to transmission owners by default.1780 In response to AEE’s proposal, MISO

the causes of study delays does not follow cost causation principles.1781
Some commenters express concerns about how RTOs/ISOs will pay penalties if

to recover study penalties.1798 NYISO argues that, if the Commission is likely to accept
RTO/ISO penalty recovery proposals, then the penalties would serve no purpose because
they would be passed to customers and fail to incentivize RTOs/ISOs to complete studies
in a more timely manner.
NYISO argues that it is unjust and unreasonable and unduly discriminatory to
apply the same level of penalties to RTOs/ISOs as other transmission providers because
they are differently situated than other transmission providers.1799 NYISO states that an
identical penalty would be much more punitive on RTOs/ISOs than other transmission
providers, so any financial penalties imposed on RTOs/ISOs should be smaller in size
and slower to trigger. NYISO requests that, if the Commission requires penalties, it
allow RTOs/ISOs to propose in their compliance filings appropriate rules for their own
regions.
NYISO further argues that Order Nos. 6721800 and 890 do not support subjecting
RTOs/ISOs to the same penalties as non-independent transmission providers.1801 NYISO
argues that the proposed penalties pose a greater risk to RTOs/ISOs than reliability
penalties, which have been assessed in rare circumstances and are subject to the

Commission’s close scrutiny.1802 NYISO also notes that it does not conduct the kinds of
transmission studies addressed in Order No. 890, so the formal applicability of the Order
No. 890 penalty regime to RTOs/ISOs does not mean that application of penalties to
RTOs/ISOs is practicable.1803
Many commenters express concerns that RTOs/ISOs may pass penalty costs
through to transmission owners or ratepayers who did not contribute to study delays,
which they claim is unjust and unreasonable.1804 New York State Department does not
support penalties unless they can be recovered from RTO/ISO bonuses or shareholder
profits.1805
Some commenters also argue that the proposal to allow RTOs/ISOs to recover
penalties from transmission owners ignores that other entities may be responsible for
study delays.1806 MISO explains, for example, that it has no mechanism to recover
penalties from affected systems and that, even for entities subject to MISO’s tariff,

consensus on a penalty pass through mechanism is likely to be elusive.1807 Several
commenters argue that, because RTOs/ISOs will have to pass through the penalty, it will
not accomplish the Commission’s goals.1808 NESCOE, however, disagrees that
RTOs/ISOs will have to pass through penalty costs but notes that the Commission
required RTOs/ISOs to file proposals to recover penalties incurred for reliability standard
violations case-by-case.1809
TAPS distinguishes NERC reliability penalties as part of a congressionally
mandated regimen, whereas the proposed penalties are not.1810 TAPS notes that, while
NERC reliability penalty amounts are used to offset operational costs of NERC or other
relevant entities, the NOPR proposes to distribute penalty costs back to interconnection
customers, who are not required to use those funds to offset costs for consumers or
ratepayers.
TAPS also seeks clarification because the NOPR proposal provided that penalties
should not be recoverable in transmission rates but also noted that penalties imposed on

RTOs/ISOs could be handled similarly to NERC reliability penalties, which the
Commission has previously allowed RTOs/ISOs to recover from ratepayers.1811 TAPS
contends that the Commission should not allow RTOs/ISOs to pass penalties through to
ratepayers or LSEs; to the extent the Commission allows RTOs/ISOs to recover costs
through FPA section 205 proceedings, TAPS recommends that the Commission
automatically waive any penalty amount the RTO/ISO would otherwise pass to
ratepayers.1812
Commenters argue that the proposed penalty structure lacks the due process and
fact finding associated with the RTO/ISO recovery of NERC reliability penalties.1813
MISO and ISO/RTO Council explain that NERC uses a fact-finding tribunal, which
avoids the potential conflicts of interest and process disruptions that would stem from
requiring the transmission provider to judge disputes.1814 Indicated PJM TOs explain that
RTOs/ISOs can only recover NERC reliability penalties from another entity if that entity
was identified and allowed to participate in the NERC process.1815 Commenters note that

financial penalties are not always imposed.1816 Further, the ISO/RTO Council argues that
the NOPR proposal to allow FPA section 205 filings to allocate penalties is unworkable
because it assumes the RTO/ISO will be able to identify a transmission owner that is
responsible for the delay.1817
ISO-NE and MISO explain that transmission providers are in no position to
perform fact-finding, which would require a time- and resource-consuming process to
hear from all involved parties.1818 MISO states that it has no procedures beyond its
alternative dispute resolution process for adjudicating disputes and even these procedures
call for multi-month processes.1819 MISO notes that it is unclear who would make the
findings and how penalties would be assigned if multiple parties contribute to a delay.1820
MISO and ISO/RTO Council note that the personnel able to determine the cause of a
delay are the interconnection study engineers, who would need to divert their resources
from performing studies to provide evidence.1821

requirement that RTOs/ISOs make an FPA section 205 filing before allocating any

owner and to be consistent with the Commission’s approach to RTO/ISO recovery of
NERC reliability penalty costs.1822
Indicated PJM TOs argue that it is unclear whether PJM has the authority to
recover penalty costs from transmission owners.1823 Indicated PJM TOs state that the
consolidated transmission owners agreement (CTOA) specifies that PJM has the right to
file “charges for recovery of PJM costs” under FPA section 205, but they argue that
penalties are not a cost of operation. Indicated PJM TOs explain that the CTOA reserves
rights not specifically transferred to PJM to transmission owners. Therefore, Indicated
PJM TOs conclude that the right to recover penalties was not conferred on PJM and that
PJM lacks the contractual authority to seek recovery of penalties from transmission
owners under FPA section 205. Indicated PJM TOs add that modifying the CTOA would
implicate the Mobile-Sierra presumption.1824

Study Deadline Extension

Several commenters support the NOPR proposal to allow for the extension of a
study deadline by mutual agreement.1827 Some commenters argue that this extension will
promote cooperation between interconnection customers and transmission providers.1828
Further, AEE argues that the extension option will provide a buffer for studies that
warrant more time and that the two study cycle transition will give transmission providers
time to adjust to the cluster model and deadlines, to understand possible variability in
each cluster, and to develop strategies for times when extra bandwidth is needed, such as
hiring third-party assistance.1829 AEE suggests that the Commission require that the
mutual agreements be publicly available.1830

NARUC supports the proposal so long as the transmission provider certifies to the
Commission that the extension will not delay unrelated interconnection requests outside
the cluster.1831
Several commenters propose modifications to the NOPR deadline extension
proposal. NYISO states that it is unreasonable to allow individual interconnection
customers to veto extensions and instead proposes that 30-day extensions should be
available if the RTO/ISO notifies the Commission that there is good cause to take
additional time to complete the study.1832 Indicated PJM TOs argue that it will be
virtually impossible to obtain mutual agreement in a region with a large number of
interconnection customers and instead propose that the transmission provider determine
the appropriate extension on compliance.1833 Tri-State notes that there is no incentive for
interconnection customers who have agreed to a study deadline to re-negotiate and
mutually agree upon an extended deadline.1834 SoCal Edison suggests that the
Commission allow transmission providers to extend study deadlines in the event of a
larger than usual cluster.1835

Duke Southeast Utilities request that the Commission clarify that transmission

SPP and NYISO also note that some transmission providers are undergoing their own

Commission or an interested party could initiate an FPA section 206 proceeding if it
believes PJM is not exercising due diligence in performing studies based on its
reporting.1851 In response to arguments that entities could pursue FPA section 206 filings
before the Commission if they believe reasonable efforts have been violated, New Jersey
Commission argues that study delays result from systemic failures, so it is inappropriate

threshold grace period, the transmission provider should be required to self-report the
circumstances around the delay to the Commission, and, in response to that self-report,
the Commission could issue a show cause order to require the transmission provider and
any other relevant entities to respond with specific information about the causes for the
delays and propose a mitigation plan.1853 MISO states that, at the conclusion of the show
cause proceeding, the Commission would issue an order that could require transmission
providers, transmission owners, or other entities to take specific actions to mitigate the

delay, require process changes, and/or impose penalties.1854 MISO argues that its
proposal has several advantages over the NOPR penalty proposal, including providing
accountability tied to entities actually causing the delay, as determined by the
Commission. Public Interest Organizations support the self-reporting concept but do not
support conditioning penalty assignment on a show cause proceeding, arguing that this
would be administratively burdensome.1855 AEE also states that MISO’s approach could
be helpful if paired with binding timelines and a clear penalty structure.1856
Clean Energy Associations suggest that, if the Commission does not adopt
penalties, it should consider requiring remedial action plans, including specific staffing
plans, for transmission providers with persistently late or inaccurate studies.1857
Some commenters argue that the Commission should incentivize transmission
providers to meet deadlines rather than penalize them for failing to do so.1858 Shell

in interconnection queue processing resources if the transmission provider satisfies
deadlines at least 90% of the time over two years.1859 Shell further suggests that these
costs can be eligible for inclusion in transmission rate base, with corresponding return on
equity, if the transmission provider meets study deadlines at least 95% of the time over
two calendar years.1860 Affected Interconnection Customers propose that the
Commission allow RTOs/ISOs to create a monetary incentive for transmission owners
that complete their interconnection studies on time.1861
However, R Street notes that rate incentives, like bonuses on returns on equity,
would induce financial motivation but would require a performance baseline that
transmission owners could game.1862 MISO TOs argue that incentives would fail because
study delays are caused by factors beyond transmission providers’ control.1863

transmission providers flexibility to set their study timelines but requests that the
Commission set a maximum allowable study timeline.1872
National Grid suggests that the Commission adopt a minimum time frame
approach, which would start the overall interconnection study timeline upon finalizing
the base case study models and provide minimum study time frames for scope and result

PJM suggests that the transmission provider develop a targeted study completion
date based on an analysis of that particular interconnection queue, with the target
completion date available for public comment.1874 PJM states that, under this approach,
as studies become delayed further and further past the target date, the transmission
provider would be required to meet increasing burdens (e.g., public posting of the missed
date, filing a report with the Commission, being subject to FPA section 206 action). PJM
states that if, despite the FPA section 206 action, the transmission provider misses a
subsequent study deadline at the same level, then the Commission could impose penalties
for any proven malfeasance by the transmission provider. PJM also suggests that the

Southeast Utilities express concern that penalties could be levied against affected system
operators for delays beyond their control and further argue that, instead of unilaterally

CREA and NewSun propose an overall “reasonableness” standard to ensure the
quality of the studies and that there is no ongoing failure to provide adequate staffing or
to employ reasonable study assumptions.1884
National Grid argues that the Commission should permit transmission providers to
assign a dedicated person to monitor the progress of each entity (i.e., interconnection
customer, transmission owner, and RTO/ISO) during the interconnection process. 1885
National Grid argues that the cost of this person and any other additional costs needed to
satisfy the NOPR proposal should be recoverable in rates so that transmission providers
would be able to recover costs incurred to reduce penalty risk.
Some commenters suggest that the Commission allow third-party consultants to
complete studies, which would conserve transmission provider resources and provide a
pathway for interconnection customers to move forward.1886 Dominion argues in

perform them.1887

We adopt the NOPR proposal to eliminate the reasonable efforts standard set forth
in sections 2.2, 3.5.4(i), 7.4, 8.3, and Attachment A to Appendix 4 of the pro forma
LGIP. In its place, we adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to add new section
3.9 to the pro forma LGIP that imposes study delay penalties, as further discussed below:
delays of cluster studies beyond the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of
$1,000 per business day; delays of cluster restudies beyond the tariff-specified deadline
will incur a penalty of $2,000 per business day; delays of affected system studies beyond

the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of $2,000 per business day; and delays of
facilities studies beyond the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of $2,500 per
business day.1891
As explained in greater detail in this Section, we adopt the following features of
the study delay penalty structure for late interconnection studies: (1) no study delay
penalties will be assessed until the third cluster study cycles (including any transitional
cluster study cycle, but not transitional serial studies) after the Commission-approved
effective date of the transmission provider’s filing in compliance with this final rule; (2)
there will be a 10-business day grace period, such that no study delay penalties will be
assessed for a study that is delayed by 10 business days or fewer; (3) deadlines may be
extended for a particular study by 30 business days by mutual agreement of the
transmission provider and all interconnection customers with interconnection requests in
the relevant study; (4) study delay penalties will be capped at 100% of the initial study
deposits received for all of the interconnection requests in the cluster for cluster studies
and cluster restudies, 100% of the initial study deposit received for the single
interconnection request in the study for facilities studies, and 100% of the study
deposit(s) that the transmission provider acting as an affected system operator (affected
system transmission provider) collects for conducting the affected system study; (5)
transmission providers will have the ability to appeal any study delay penalties to the

relief requested on appeal; (6) transmission providers must distribute study delay
penalties to interconnection customers in the relevant study on a pro rata per
interconnection request basis to offset their study costs; (7) non-RTO/ISO transmission
providers and transmission-owning members of RTOs/ISOs may not recover study delay
penalties through transmission rates; (8) RTOs/ISOs may submit an FPA section 205
filing to propose a default structure for recovering study delay penalties and/or to recover
the costs of any specific study delay penalties;1892 (9) transmission providers must pay the
penalty for each late study on a pro rata basis per interconnection request to all
interconnection customers or affected system interconnection customers included in the
relevant study that did not withdraw, or were not deemed withdrawn, from the
interconnection queue before the missed study deadline; and (10) transmission providers
must post quarterly on their OASIS or other publicly accessible website (a) the total
amount of study delay penalties from the previous reporting quarter and (b) the highest
study delay penalty paid to a single interconnection customer in the previous reporting
quarter. We also add new section (f)(1) to 18 CFR section 35.28(f)(1)(ii) to specify that
any public utility that conducts interconnection studies shall be liable for and eligible to

majeure penalty exception. We first discuss our overarching rationale for this set of
reforms, and then discuss each of these reforms in greater detail and our rationale for
each.
We adopt these reforms to remedy the unjust and unreasonable rates stemming
from interconnection queue backlogs and to ensure that interconnection customers are
able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and
timely manner. Specifically, these reforms will help ensure more timely processing of
interconnection requests by incentivizing transmission providers to meet interconnection

Eliminating the Reasonable Efforts Standard

We adopt the NOPR proposal to eliminate the reasonable efforts standard set forth
in sections 2.2, 3.5.4(i), 7.4, 8.3, and Attachment A to Appendix 4 of the pro forma
LGIP. In these revised sections, we specifically eliminate the reasonable efforts standard
for conducting cluster studies, cluster restudies, facilities studies, and affected system
studies.
The lengthy interconnection study delays and interconnection queue backlogs
throughout the country support our conclusion that the reasonable efforts standard does
not provide an adequate incentive for transmission providers to complete interconnection

studies on time. As discussed in Section II above, transmission providers are
experiencing significant interconnection queue backlogs, as evidenced, for example, by
their Order No. 845 reports.1894 There is every reason to believe that many of the factors
contributing to significant interconnection queue backlogs and delay—including the
rapidly changing resource mix, market forces, and emerging technologies—will persist.
In response to those ongoing challenges, we find that it is just, reasonable, and not unduly
discriminatory or preferential to eliminate the reasonable efforts standard and adopt a
penalty structure that reasonably incentivizes transmission providers to ensure the timely
processing of interconnection requests. We note that we are not finding that transmission
providers have necessarily acted in bad faith or that their actions are the sole reason for
the queue delays. Indeed, throughout this final rule, we adopt numerous reforms to
appropriately incentivize interconnection customers to help reduce interconnection delays
that may result from their conduct. Nevertheless, we find that the elimination of the
reasonable efforts standard and the adoption of penalties for late studies are needed to

1894

See Appendix B to this final rule (showing that over 2,800 interconnection
studies were delayed as of the end of Q4 2022 and that over 1,900 interconnection studies
were delayed as of the end of Q4 2021); see also Queued Up 2023 at 6 (showing growth
in number of interconnection requests from 2013 to 2022) and Queued Up 2023 at 3
(noting that generating facilities built in 2008 spent, on average, less than two years in
interconnection queues, whereas generating facilities built in 2022 spent, on average, five
years in interconnection queues). Although some commenters argue that Order No. 845
data do not provide sufficient support (AEP Initial Comments at 25-26; MISO Initial
Comments at 72), the data demonstrate that interconnection queue delays have continued
to worsen over recent years and industry reports have similarly concluded that
interconnection queues are seeing increasingly severe delays. We cite evidence that
contradicts such comments and that, instead, supports our findings. See, e.g., supra
Section II.C.

create an incentive for transmission providers, which will help reduce interconnection
delays and ensure that Commission-jurisdictional rates are just, reasonable, and not
unduly discriminatory or preferential.
The reasonable efforts standard worsens current-day challenges, as it fails to
ensure that transmission providers are keeping pace with the changing and complex
dynamics of today’s interconnection queues. Contrary to the assertions of some
commenters, we believe that there are steps within transmission providers’ control, from
deploying transmission providers’ resources to exploring administrative efficiencies and
innovative study approaches,1895 to better ensure timely processing of interconnection
studies to remedy existing deficiencies.
As discussed above, we adopt several reforms to address speculative
interconnection requests by imposing stricter requirements on interconnection customers
for entering and remaining in the interconnection queue (e.g., site control requirements,
commercial readiness deposits, and withdrawal penalties). We also adopt reforms to
improve the efficiency of interconnection studies and interconnection queue processing
for all transmission providers (e.g., first-ready, first-served cluster study process). In this
Section, we adopt reforms to ensure that transmission providers are doing their part as
well by eliminating the reasonable efforts standard and imposing study delay penalties on

fields have the potential to reduce queue processing times).

transmission providers when they fail to meet the interconnection study deadlines we
adopt in this final rule. Based on the record, we find that the elimination of the
reasonable efforts standard and its replacement with firm deadlines and penalties are
needed to remedy unjust and unreasonable rates and ensure that interconnection
customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient,
transparent, and timely manner. Thus, we disagree with commenters that contend that the
reasonable efforts standard continues to be appropriate or that the Commission’s past
orders, including Order No. 845, mean that the reasonable efforts standard continues to
ensure just and reasonable rates.1896
We similarly disagree with commenters that support eliminating the reasonable
efforts standard but that do not support imposing study delay penalties on transmission
providers for failing to meet interconnection study deadlines.1897 We do not believe that
this result would remedy the unjust and unreasonable rates, nor would it ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner by aligning incentives properly.

As we are eliminating the reasonable efforts standard, we also must adopt a
replacement rate that remedies the problems just described. The sections below set forth
a study delay penalty structure and why we believe it is justified. In short, we adopt
provisions in the pro forma LGIP that impose firm interconnection study deadlines and
corresponding study delay penalties on transmission providers that fail to meet those
deadlines.
Interconnection customers face financial harm when study deadlines are not met,
ultimately inhibiting their ability to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable,
efficient, transparent, and timely manner. We find that holding transmission providers to
firm interconnection study deadlines is likely to accelerate the interconnection study
process and provide greater certainty to interconnection customers, allowing them to
make more informed business decisions around whether to proceed with or withdraw
from the interconnection queue, which will also ultimately improve interconnection
queue management and remedy the unjust and unreasonable rates otherwise created by
study delays.
At the same time, we do not believe that the study delay penalty structure that we
adopt in this final rule is unduly harsh for transmission providers, either in penalty
amount or the form of its application. The study delay penalty structure adopted in this
final rule balances the harm to interconnection customers of interconnection study delays
and the associated need to incentivize transmission providers to timely complete
interconnection studies with the burdens on transmission providers of conducting
interconnection studies and potentially facing penalties for delays, including those that

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 628 -

may be caused or exacerbated by factors beyond their control. In particular, we adopt the
following safeguards for transmission providers: (1) a transition period rather than
imposing study delay penalties as soon as transmission providers begin implementing the
reforms in this final rule; (2) a 10-business day grace period where no study delay
penalties will be assessed; (3) a provision that allows a 30-business day deadline
extension upon mutual agreement of the transmission provider and interconnection
customers; (4) caps on study delay penalties; and (5) a transmission provider ability to
appeal. We also adopt provisions governing distribution of study delay penalties to
interconnection customers and prohibiting recovery of study delay penalties through
transmission rates, along with transparency-related posting requirements to the benefit of
interconnection customers and consumers alike. We believe that the study delay penalty
structure adopted herein aligns transmission provider and interconnection customer
incentives while providing appropriate built-in flexibility and safeguards for transmission
providers, thereby achieving a balance that ensures just and reasonable rates and ensures
that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.
ii.

Penalty Amount

We modify the pro forma LGIP to adopt a study delay penalty structure whereby
penalties increase through the interconnection study process. Delays of cluster studies
beyond the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of $1,000 per business day;
delays of cluster restudies beyond the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of
$2,000 per business day; delays of affected system studies beyond the tariff-specified

- 629 -

deadline will incur a penalty of $2,000 per business day; and delays of facilities studies
beyond the tariff-specified deadline will incur a penalty of $2,500 per business day.
We agree with the numerous commenters who argue that the NOPR penalty
proposal of $500 per business day is too low to create an incentive for transmission
providers to meet study deadlines.1898 We find it necessary to modify the NOPR proposal
to establish a higher penalty amount and a structure of increasing penalties that reflects
the greater harm caused by delayed studies at later interconnection stages.
We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, we find persuasive the
comments asserting that a penalty of $500 per business day is insufficient to incentivize
transmission provider actions that will reduce the incidence of study delays.1899 At $500

per business day, a study that is delayed by six months—or roughly 126 business days—
would produce a penalty of only $63,000. We view such a penalty as insufficient
considering that the purpose of the penalty is to incentivize timely study completion that
may be achieved, for example, by hiring additional personnel or investing in new
software.
Some commenters advocate for penalty amounts that more closely approximate
the costs that delays impose in interconnection customers,1900 while others propose
penalty amounts ranging from $2,500 per day to $7,000 per day.1901 Based on the record
before us, we believe the $1,000/$2,000/$2,500 per business day penalty structure,
combined with the transition, grace period, cap on penalties, and ability to appeal that we
adopt below, strikes an appropriate balance because it creates an incentive for
transmission providers to meet study deadlines while not being overly punitive.
Second, adopting progressively higher penalty amounts for delayed cluster
restudies and facilities studies reflects the progressively greater harm to interconnection
customers of delayed studies at those later stages—at which they will have made greater
investments in advancing their projects toward commercial development through steps
such as obtaining site control, securing permits, and contracting for equipment. This is

especially true given the new site control requirements, commercial readiness deposits,
and withdrawal penalties we adopt in this final rule, which also become increasingly
stringent as the study process progresses. These reforms will require that interconnection
customers have greater capital at risk at each stage to affirm their commitment to
reaching commercial operation. We find it appropriate that transmission providers face
study delay penalties structured in a similar manner to provide adequate incentives to
complete interconnection studies on time.
Third, the penalty structure we adopt here will impose more stringent study delay
penalties at later stages when reasons for study delays should be fewest. That is, we
expect the volume of interconnection requests to decrease as they progress through the
study process, with fewer interconnection requests reaching the cluster restudy and
facilities study stages. This reduction in volume will reduce the likelihood transmission
providers are unable to complete those studies on time. We find it reasonable to hold
transmission providers most accountable for timely study completion in the stages where
delays should be most avoidable.
iii.

Transition

We modify proposed section 3.9(6) of the pro forma LGIP, which provided that
no study delay penalties shall be assessed until one cluster study cycle (that is not a
transitional study cycle) after the Commission-approved effective date of the
transmission provider’s filing in compliance with this final rule. Instead, we modify that
section to provide that no study delay penalties shall be assessed until the third cluster
study cycle after the Commission-approved effective date of the compliance filing

(including any transitional cluster study cycle, but not transitional serial studies).1902 We
believe that giving transmission providers time to adapt to the new processes without
imposing study delay penalties immediately will help ensure that transmission providers’
implementation of this final rule has begun to reduce backlogged interconnection queues:
i.e., we expect transmission providers to meet the interconnection study deadlines once
they are implementing the cluster study process, with the increased requirements on
interconnection customers (e.g., site control requirements, commercial readiness deposits,
and withdrawal penalties) to help prevent speculative interconnection requests from
entering and remaining in the interconnection queue.
We adopt Duke Southeast Utilities’ request to specify that transmission providers
already using a cluster study process will not be subject to penalties until the third cluster
study cycle after the Commission-approved effective date of the transmission provider’s
filing in compliance with this final rule.1903 We agree that transmission providers that
already use a cluster study process should not be incentivized to employ an unnecessary
transition process in response to this final rule simply to delay the possibility of study
delay penalties. Accordingly, we modify the NOPR proposal such that no transmission
providers will be assessed study delay penalties until the third cluster study cycle after the
Commission-approved effective date of the compliance filing.

Grace Period

In addition to adopting a study delay penalty amount that we believe balances
incentivizing transmission providers while not being overly punitive, we adopt in pro
forma LGIP section 3.9(4) a 10-business day grace period, such that no study delay
penalties will be assessed for a study that is delayed by 10 business days or fewer, and if
the study is delayed by more than 10 business days, the penalty amount will be calculated
from the first business day the transmission provider exceeds the applicable study
deadline. We believe that this 10-business day grace period will provide an appropriate
level of flexibility for transmission providers to address unforeseen circumstances or
complexities that arise in the study process. We also believe that this grace period will
lessen any administrative burden associated with the appeals process or RTO/ISO
recovery of study delay penalty costs, as studies with short delays will not incur study
delay penalties that may trigger appeals filings or the need for RTO/ISO penalty
recovery.
v.

Study Deadline Extension

We adopt the NOPR proposal in pro forma LGIP section 3.9(5) to allow
extensions of the deadline for a particular study by 30 business days by mutual agreement
of the transmission provider and all interconnection customers with interconnection
requests in the relevant study. We believe that this reform will promote cooperation
between transmission providers and interconnection customers and incentivize
transmission providers to keep interconnection customers informed of the status of study
processes.

We decline to adopt AEE’s suggestion to require transmission providers to
publicly post when a study deadline is extended by mutual agreement.1904 We do not find
it necessary to require such public posting because transmission providers are being given
sufficient incentive to minimize delays and manage all interconnection studies fairly. We
also decline to adopt NARUC’s suggestion to require transmission providers to certify
that extensions will not delay unrelated interconnection requests outside the cluster.1905
Transmission providers will be sufficiently incentivized to ensure that such extensions do
not delay other studies because any such delays may incur study delay penalties, as
described in this Section. In response to commenters that argue that it will be difficult to
obtain mutual agreement in large regions, we do not view that as a reason to decline to
adopt or to modify the proposal.1906 If an interconnection study is delayed, and mutual
agreement cannot be obtained, the transmission provider will be assessed the
corresponding study delay penalties and may file an appeal with the Commission to
explain any relevant circumstances.
vi.

Cap on Penalties

We modify proposed section 3.9(2) of the pro forma LGIP, which capped study
delay penalties at 100% of the total study deposit received for the late interconnection
study, to instead cap penalties at: (1) 100% of the initial study deposits received for all of

the interconnection requests in the cluster for cluster studies and cluster restudies;1907
(2) 100% of the initial study deposit received for the single interconnection request in the
study for facilities studies; and (3) 100% of the study deposit(s) that the affected system
transmission provider collects for conducting the affected system study. As discussed in
the Section III.A.2.6.a above, we modify the NOPR proposal and require transmission
providers to collect a single study deposit from interconnection customers only upon
entry into the cluster (initial study deposit), rather than a study deposit at each phase of
the study process, as proposed in the NOPR. Accordingly, we modify the study delay
penalty cap to reflect this change in the study deposit requirements. By tying the study
delay penalty cap to the study deposits, we ensure that the maximum penalty bears a
relationship to the costs of the study that was late and is not unnecessarily punitive.
In response to commenters who argue that study delay penalties should not be
capped,1908 or that the cap should be higher than 100% of the study deposits for the late
interconnection study,1909 we believe that imposing study delay penalties that exceed the

In response to Invenergy’s request for clarification, we confirm that the cap will
not be impacted by any withdrawal penalties.1910
vii.

Ability to Appeal

We further modify the NOPR proposal to include, in section 3.9(3) of the pro
forma LGIP, the ability for transmission providers to appeal any study delay penalties to
the Commission.1911 Any such appeal must be filed no later than 45 calendar days after
the late study has been completed. The Commission will evaluate whether good cause
exists to grant relief from the study delay penalty and will issue an order granting or
denying relief. In evaluating whether there is good cause to grant such relief, the
Commission may consider, among other factors: (1) extenuating circumstances outside
the transmission provider’s control, such as delays in affected system study results;
(2) efforts of the transmission provider to mitigate delays; and (3) the extent to which the
transmission provider has proposed process enhancements either in the stakeholder

the appeal have been filed, or (2) the date that any requests for rehearing of the

providers have an incentive to meet interconnection study deadlines with protections to
ensure that any such penalties are fair and not triggered if good cause justifies the delay.
The protections embedded in this appeal process address commenters’ concerns that there
be adequate due process and/or fact-finding before imposing a study delay penalty on

reasonable replacement rate to ensure that transmission providers are properly
incentivized to address these factors. We do not find it appropriate to impose penalties
only where a factor can be conclusively demonstrated to be within a transmission
provider’s control, as this would impose significant administrative burden. It may be
difficult to precisely determine the cause of any given delay, especially where delay
occurs due to multiple factors. Further, transmission providers’ concerns are addressed to
some extent through the ability to appeal described above, which provides an opportunity
for relief from any study delay penalties. Further, we note that many of the reforms
adopted in this final rule will help to mitigate factors that may prolong the study process,
such as the submission of speculative interconnection requests. In addition, the reforms
adopted regarding affected system coordination—discussed later in this final rule—will
address delays resulting from affected system studies. We disagree with Indicated PJM
TOs that a complete de novo review is needed to assess study delay penalties.1914 We
find that the good cause standard adopted in this final rule1915 provides an adequate
framework through which the Commission can evaluate whether it is appropriate to grant
relief from any applicable penalties.

Distribution of Study Delay Penalties to
Interconnection Customers

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, set forth in pro forma LGIP
section 3.9(1), to require transmission providers to distribute study delay penalties on a
pro rata basis per interconnection request to the interconnection customers and affected
system interconnection customers included in the relevant study that did not withdraw, or
were not deemed withdrawn, from the interconnection queue before the missed study
deadline. Unless the transmission provider files an appeal to the study penalty, the study
delay penalty must be distributed no later than 45 calendar days after the late study has
been completed. Specifically, a study delay penalty for a delayed cluster study or cluster
restudy must be distributed on a pro rata basis per interconnection request to all
interconnection customers in the cluster, per the requirements above. A study delay
penalty for a delayed facilities study must be distributed to the interconnection customer
whose facilities were being studied, per the requirements above. Further, a study delay
penalty for a delayed affected system study must be distributed to the affected system
interconnection customer(s) whose generating facility was being studied by an affected
system transmission provider, per the requirements above. In response to PG&E’s
request for clarification,1916 the study delay penalties are on a per business day basis and
will be distributed equally to each delayed interconnection customer per the requirements
above.

We find the distribution of the study delay penalties imposed due to a delay in the
study, which defray the study costs of the interconnection customers affected by that
delay, to be just and reasonable, as they will ensure that interconnection customers are
able to interconnect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.

No Recovery in Transmission Rates or from
Interconnection Customers

Regarding recovery of study delay penalties, we modify the NOPR proposal to
prohibit non-RTO/ISO transmission providers and transmission-owning members of
RTOs/ISOs from recovering study delay penalty amounts through transmission rates.
This treatment of study delay penalties is consistent with the treatment of penalties
imposed pursuant to Order No. 8901917 and will ensure that the study delay penalties have
the incentivizing effect discussed above. Because the at-fault transmission provider’s
shareholders will pay the penalty, this prohibition addresses commenters’ concerns1918
that study delay penalty costs will ultimately be borne by customers and ratepayers
through increased transmission costs.1919

Additionally, we decline to allow any transmission provider to recover study delay
penalties from interconnection customers to the extent the interconnection customers
cause delays. If a study delay is caused by an interconnection customer, and not the
transmission provider, that would represent a potentially compelling basis for the
Commission to find that good cause exists to waive the study delay penalties. Further,
we note that, in the event that an interconnection request is incomplete or an
interconnection customer misses a deadline, those interconnection requests are subject to
the withdrawal provisions of pro forma LGIP section 3.7.

Penalty Recovery in RTOs/ISOs

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to require RTOs/ISOs to submit requests
to recover the costs of specific study delay penalties under FPA section 205. RTOs/ISOs
may instead submit an FPA section 205 filing to propose a default structure for
recovering study delay penalties and/or make individual FPA section 205 filings to
recover the costs of any specific study delay penalties. We believe that this discretion for
RTOs/ISOs will reduce the administrative burden associated with study delay penalty
cost recovery and will allow RTOs/ISOs the flexibility to craft rules that work for their
region. In response to ACORE’s recommendation that RTOs/ISOs provide criteria for
how they will assign study delay penalties, we note that RTOs/ISOs may file FPA section

We modify the NOPR proposal to adopt 18 CFR section 35.28(f)(1)(ii) to specify
that, for RTOs/ISOs in which the transmission-owning members perform certain
interconnection studies, the study delay penalties imposed under the new pro forma LGIP
will be imposed directly on the transmission-owning member(s) that conducted the late
study, thereby mooting the issue of how RTOs/ISOs recover those specific penalties. We
believe that this change will also reduce the administrative burden, as RTOs/ISOs will
typically not need to seek cost recovery for late facilities studies because those studies are
often conducted by transmission-owning members. This change will also ensure that the
study delay penalties are imposed on the public utility with the most control over whether
the study deadline is met, i.e., the public utility conducting the study. Doing so aligns the
incentive created by the study delay penalty with the entity most in control of the study
timeline. This change also responds to AEE’s suggestion to assign RTO/ISO study delay
penalties directly to transmission owners, OPSI’s contention that RTOs/ISOs may be
reluctant to seek cost recovery from transmission owners, and TAPS’ concern that
RTOs/ISOs would need well-supported cases to assign study delay penalties to
transmission owners.1921

imposed automatically on the RTO/ISO under the pro forma LGIP. As explained above,
RTOs/ISOs may file an FPA section 205 proposal to recover the costs of study delay
penalties. Concerns about any such proposals are best addressed in the relevant FPA
section 205 proceedings. For the same reason, we decline to adopt TAPS’
recommendation that the Commission provide an automatic waiver of any study delay
penalty amount the RTO/ISO would otherwise pass to ratepayers,1923 as such
determinations are best made on a case-by-case basis. In response to Indicated PJM TOs
argument that PJM lacks the contractual authority to seek recovery of study delay
penalties from transmission owners,1924 PJM’s authority to recover costs from its
transmission-owning members can be properly addressed in any future FPA section 205
proceeding.

impose an administrative and litigative burden on RTOs/ISOs and the Commission,1925

delay penalties not attributable to an RTO/ISO transmission owning member.1926 As an
initial matter, we believe that any such burden is outweighed by the need to create an
incentive to ensure that transmission providers timely complete interconnection studies.
Also, we find that RTOs/ISOs do not face differing or greater burdens that warrant
different treatment than non-RTO/ISO transmission providers. The pro forma LGIP
applies to all transmission providers, RTO/ISO and non-RTO/ISO alike. To the extent
that RTOs/ISOs elect to create a tariff mechanism for recovering study delay penalties,
rather than relying on individual filings, as noted above, the RTO/ISO may submit an
FPA section 205 filing to propose such a default structure. Finally, where the
transmission-owning members of an RTO/ISO perform interconnection studies, there is
little-to-no “fact-finding” to be done to determine to which public utility to assign study
delay penalties, as the transmission owner will be automatically assigned the penalty
pursuant 18 CFR section 35.28(f)(1)(ii).
In response to concerns that RTOs/ISOs have no ability to pay study delay
penalties without collecting them from another party,1927 we note that RTOs/ISOs have

several options under this final rule for collecting study delay penalties. As discussed
above, RTOs/ISOs may submit FPA section 205 filings to seek recovery for study delay
penalties from public utilities contributing to study delays. The FPA section 205 filing
could propose either to establish a tariff mechanism for assigning costs generally or for
assigning costs for specific study delay penalties. RTOs/ISOs also have other ways to
fund study delay penalties beyond the revenue they collect for sales of transmission
service: for example, RTOs/ISOs collect administrative fees from market
participants.1928
We disagree with NYISO that study delay penalties would threaten the financial
viability of RTOs/ISOs or fail to incentivize RTOs/ISOs to complete studies by the
required deadlines. The evidence in this record does not demonstrate that the study delay
penalty structure that we adopt in this final rule, combined with the multiple adopted
safeguards, including a total cap on study delay penalty amounts, would threaten the
financial viability of an RTO/ISO, particularly given that RTOs/ISOs may submit FPA
section 205 filings to recover study delay penalties. Additionally, as noted, we find that it

integrated marketplace clearing administrative service from transmission customers and

recovers the costs of its control area administration service, which includes “preserving
the reliability of the PJM Region and administering Point-to-Point Transmission Service

is appropriate to incentivize RTOs/ISOs to meet study deadlines in the same manner as
non-RTO/ISO transmission providers. Thus, we also disagree with NYISO that the study
delay penalties for RTOs/ISOs should be smaller in size and slower to trigger.1929 As
discussed above, we believe that the study delay penalty structure strikes a reasonable
balance by providing an adequate incentive without being punitive.
AEP and TAPS assert that the imposition of study delay penalties will
disincentivize RTO/ISO participation.1930 We are not persuaded that any such
disincentive outweighs the benefits of adopting study delay penalties. We expect that an
incentive for transmission providers to meet interconnection study deadlines will result in
more efficient interconnection queue processing, which will benefit competition and, in
the long run, customers within a transmission provider’s region, including within
RTO/ISO regions. We continue to believe that customers are more likely to experience
lower overall costs if the industry relies on robust wholesale competition to determine the
appropriate level of generation and related transmission development.1931
We find that applying study delay penalties to RTOs/ISOs for failing to meet
interconnection study deadlines is consistent with Commission precedent and continues
to be appropriate, particularly given the extent of interconnection queue backlogs in
RTOs/ISOs. We disagree with NYISO that, because RTOs/ISOs may be at greater risk

of being assessed study delay penalties than reliability penalties, this meaningfully
distinguishes study delay penalties from the Commission’s findings in Order Nos. 672-A
and 890 related to reliability penalties.1932 In response to NYISO’s comment that
reliability penalties receive the Commission’s close scrutiny, we note that transmission
providers will have an opportunity to seek relief from a penalty by filing an appeal, which
the Commission will closely scrutinize and in response to which the Commission will
issue an order.1933

Posting Requirements

For transparency purposes, we adopt the proposed requirements in pro forma
LGIP section 3.9(7) that transmission providers must post on their OASIS or other
publicly accessible website on a quarterly basis, within 30 calendar days of the end of the
calendar quarter, (1) the total amount of study delay penalties from the previous reporting
quarter, and (2) the highest amount of such study delay penalties repaid to a single
interconnection customer during the previous reporting quarter. We also adopt the

transitional cluster study cycle, but not transitional serial studies) after the transmission
provider transitions to the cluster study process. We believe that this additional
information will be helpful to the public and the Commission in tracking the status of
interconnection queue delays and that the burden on transmission providers of posting
this information will be minimal.
xii.

Force Majeure Exception

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to exempt transmission providers from
study delay penalties where force majeure applies. We believe that this exemption is
unwarranted: transmission providers may explain in any appeal to the Commission any
circumstances that caused the delay, including any events that qualify as force majeure,
and the Commission will consider such circumstances as part of its evaluation of whether
good cause exists to grant relief from the otherwise applicable study delay penalties.
xiii.

Transmission Provider Resources

In response to commenters that raise concerns about transmission provider
resources to complete studies on time, we first emphasize that the overall set of reforms
in this final rule should significantly streamline and reduce the number of interconnection
studies that a transmission provider must conduct, easing the burden on transmission
providers. With the benefit of fewer studies and fewer speculative generating facilities in
the interconnection queue, we expect that a transmission provider that faces the potential
of a study delay penalty for failing to meet interconnection study deadlines will be able to
allocate sufficient resources to conduct interconnection studies, in addition to

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 649 -

implementing reforms to ensure that its study process is efficient. In this final rule, we
adopt interconnection study deadlines for a transmission provider to complete cluster
studies, cluster restudies, facilities studies, and affected system studies. As discussed
above, we believe that the interconnection study deadlines will give transmission
providers sufficient time to conduct the relevant studies, e.g., 150 calendar days for the
completion of the cluster study, and we have demonstrated that the existing pro forma
generator interconnection procedures and agreements are insufficient to ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.1934 We therefore believe that the
record supports the imposition of study delay penalties for failure to meet those
deadlines.
Some commenters argue that other NOPR proposals, such as the optional resource
solicitation studies, optional informational interconnection studies, and evaluation of
advanced transmission technologies, will consume transmission provider resources
otherwise dedicated to interconnection studies.1935 Similarly, other commenters argue
that imposing firm study deadlines will force transmission providers to redirect resources
and personnel away from other necessary functions such as transmission planning or
deprive them of financial resources and make it harder to retain qualified personnel.1936

We note that we do not adopt the NOPR proposals to implement optional informational
interconnection studies or optional resource solicitation studies and adopt a modified
version of the NOPR proposal to require evaluation of certain enumerated advanced
transmission technologies, which should reduce the burden on transmission providers as
compared to that under the NOPR. Further, to these arguments, we note that it is the
transmission provider’s responsibility to manage its organizational resources—including
attracting and retaining sufficient qualified personnel to meet its responsibilities—and
that it is within the transmission provider’s ability to improve how it manages its internal
resources. If, for whatever reason, the transmission provider is not able to meet firm
study deadlines, that is an issue the transmission provider is free to raise in appealing any
penalties it incurs. While we are not persuaded that transmission providers will
necessarily need to reassess their organizational needs to meet study deadlines, given the
suite of reforms adopted in the final rule, to the extent that such steps are required, they
are warranted to fulfill our responsibility under the FPA to ensure just and reasonable
rates and to ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect in a reliable,
efficient, transparent, and timely manner.
We disagree with SoCal Edison and New York State Department that transmission
providers will require additional resources to track and allocate study delay penalties,

potentially increasing the cost of administering interconnection queues.1937 We note that
transmission providers already track the progress of their interconnection queues and
should be aware of study deadlines, especially as their tariffs currently require reasonable
efforts to meet such deadlines. As a result, determining when study delay penalties apply
will be as straightforward as determining how many studies are late and past the 10business day grace period from the applicable study deadline. As explained above, we
anticipate that other provisions of this final rule will result in improved interconnection
queue management and processing, which should ease the burden on transmission
providers over time.
We also disagree with commenters that firm study deadlines with study delay
penalties will necessarily reduce interconnection study flexibility1938 and accuracy,1939 as

well as system reliability.1940 We reiterate that it is within transmission providers’ ability
to improve interconnection study processes and policies and take other measures, such as
hiring additional staff, to efficiently process interconnection queues without sacrificing
accuracy, flexibility, or reliability. Study delay penalties will incentivize these actions,
especially given transmission providers’ independent responsibilities to deliver accurate
studies and to ensure system reliability. Thus, we agree with the New Jersey Commission
that there is not an inherent tradeoff between holding transmission providers accountable
and transmission system reliability. In addition, we further agree that the failure to bring
new generating facilities online in a timely manner can also create reliability and economic
risk.1941 Moreover, interconnection customers, rather than transmission providers,
ultimately bear the costs of interconnection studies. To the extent that it is more costly to
complete studies in a timely and accurate fashion, these interconnection study costs will be
passed on to interconnection customers. Further, as noted above, the study delay penalty
structure includes significant safeguards for the transmission provider, such as the
transition period, the 10-business day grace period, the penalty cap, the ability to extend
deadlines by mutual agreement, and the ability to appeal any study delay penalties to the
Commission.

Coordination Among Transmission Providers,
Interconnection Customers, and Affected Systems

Several commenters raise concerns related to affected systems, and coordination
among transmission providers, interconnection customers, and affected systems. In
response to NARUC’s request for clarification regarding affected system studies, we note
that new pro forma LGIP section 3.9 will apply to all transmission providers when they
are acting as an affected system operator (affected system transmission providers).1942 As
a result, affected system transmission providers are also subject to a study delay penalty
for a late affected system study. Thus, contrary to commenters’ arguments that the
NOPR proposal ignores that other entities, such as affected systems, may be responsible
for study delays,1943 affected system transmission providers will face the same incentive
as the host transmission provider to timely complete their studies. In addition, where a
delay for a host transmission provider’s cluster or facilities studies is caused by affected
system study delays, the host transmission provider can file an appeal of any applicable
study delay penalty with the Commission and include such details in its claim of good
cause for relief.
We disagree with commenters’ concerns that the study delay penalty structure
would decrease or harm coordination between transmission providers, interconnection
customers, and affected systems,1944 and/or create tension between RTOs/ISOs,

transmission owners, developers, or other parties.1945 The incentive for transmission
providers to timely complete interconnection studies created by the study delay penalty
structure should improve coordination among transmission providers and interconnection
customers to ensure that transmission providers have the information needed to complete
the studies and, if there is an issue, to pursue a potential extension of the deadline via
mutual agreement. We note that other reforms adopted in this final rule will improve
clarity and efficiency around affected system studies, which should improve coordination
with affected systems. In addition, affected system transmission providers are also
subject to study delay penalties for delayed affected system studies, which should
encourage better coordination. We also believe that an ability to appeal study delay
penalties will provide a structured forum for parties to dispute claims, placing the
Commission in the position of decisionmaker when it comes to determining whether to
excuse study delay penalties.
We disagree with AECI that there is no benefit to imposing penalties on affected
system transmission providers for failure to timely complete affected system studies.
These studies equally affect interconnection customer certainty and interconnection
process efficiency, and as such, we believe that the penalty structure enumerated above

will also incentivize transmission providers to complete affected system studies in a
timely manner. Indeed, the Commission has addressed several instances where affected
system studies have delayed or otherwise affected interconnection study timelines and
processes,1946 and therefore, without imposing a penalty structure, we are not convinced
that transmission providers will timely complete their affected system studies. In the
same vein, we agree with Interwest that monetary penalties for failure to meet the
affected system study deadline will incentivize discipline and support investment needed
to meet affected system study timelines.
In response to ENGIE, MISO, and Duke Southeast Utilities’ comments on the
distribution of study delay penalties for failure to timely complete affected system
studies, we note that any study delay penalties will be distributed on a pro rata basis per
interconnection request to the affected system interconnection customers included in the
relevant study that did not withdraw, or were not deemed withdrawn, from the
interconnection queue before the missed study deadline.
xv.

Commission Authority and Precedent

Some commenters argue that the proposed study delay penalty structure is an
unjustified shift from precedent established in Order No. 845, in which the Commission
expressly declined to impose penalties.1947 We disagree. As we explain above,

interconnection queue delays in many parts of the country have worsened since Order
No. 845, and the record indicates that the failure of transmission providers to timely
complete studies is a significant part of the reason why. For example, in the single year
between 2021 and 2022, there was marked increase in the average length of time
customers have been waiting in the interconnection queue, increasing from roughly
4 to 5 years, while at the same time seeing the total interconnection queue size increased
from 1,400 GW to more than 2,000 GW.1948 Based on the recent interconnection study
metrics transmission providers posted in compliance with Order No. 845, of the 2,179
interconnection studies completed in 2022, 68% were issued late.1949 Furthermore, at the
end of 2022, an additional 2,544 studies were delayed (i.e., ongoing and past their
deadline).1950 All of the RTOs/ISOs except CAISO and 14 non-RTO/ISO transmission
providers reported delayed studies at the end of 2022.1951 We believe that this large
number of delayed studies is a significant part of the explanation for the extensive delays
and growing interconnection queues documented above and in the Overall Need for

Reform Section. Accordingly, based on the evidence in this record, we find that study
delay penalties are an appropriate component of a just, reasonable, and not unduly
discriminatory or preferential replacement rate to remedy these interconnection delays
and the consequences they have for Commission-jurisdictional rates.1952
Similarly, in response to commenters who argue that the proposed study delay
penalty structure differs from the penalty structure implemented in Order No. 890 for
transmission service studies,1953 we believe that such differences are warranted by the
significant and growing interconnection queue backlogs. We agree with PacifiCorp that,
compared to transmission service requests, interconnection studies are more numerous,
complex, and susceptible to delays.1954 Further, as noted above, there is a growing
number of interconnection customers affected by study delays. We believe that these
factors underscore the need for transmission providers to meet study deadlines and the
need to provide an incentive, in the form of study delay penalties. We find that the other
reforms adopted in this final rule will streamline interconnection processes: for example,
the cluster study process will reduce the number of interconnection studies that any
transmission provider must conduct at a given time, thus reducing the potential for study

delay penalties to accumulate relative to the serial study process in place today. We find
that the elimination of the reasonable efforts standard and adoption of the study delay
penalty structure will incentivize transmission providers to take appropriate steps to meet
the study deadlines in their tariffs.
We also disagree with TAPS’ assertion that reliability penalties are permissible
because they are part of a congressionally mandated regime, whereas the study delay
penalties are not.1955 We find that FPA section 206 provides us with the authority to
establish a structure to impose study delay penalties because such delays render
Commission-jurisdictional rates unjust and unreasonable, as explained in the Overall
Need for Reform Section, and we believe that this structure reflects a just and reasonable
replacement rate.1956 As discussed above, an RTO/ISO has different options for
recovering those penalties, and we are not in this final rule dictating which option an
RTO/ISO must choose. Further, TAPS’ argument that reliability penalties are used to
offset NERC’s operation costs but the interconnection study delay penalties will not be
used to offset costs for consumers or ratepayers does not change our conclusion.1957 We
do not believe that our authority to require study delay penalties as part of a just and
reasonable replacement rate turns on the entity whose costs are offset by the penalties
collected, and as discussed above, we find it appropriate in this circumstance to use study

penalties to offset the interconnection study costs for interconnection customers that are
affected by the study delays.
Moreover, automatic tariff-based penalty mechanisms similar to that which we
adopt in this final rule exist in a variety of other contexts. For example, RTO/ISO tariffs
include penalties for “traffic ticket” violations that are penalized without referral to the
Commission.1958 In that context, the Commission has approved such automatic penalties
where (1) the activity is expressly set forth in the tariff, (2) the activity involves
objectively identifiable behavior, and (3) the activity does not subject the actor to
sanctions or consequences other than those expressly approved by the Commission and
set forth in the tariff, with the ability to appeal1959 to the Commission.1960 That is the
same structure we are adopting here: the study delay penalties (1) will be expressly set
forth in the tariff, (2) will be based on objectively identifiable behavior (i.e., whether a
study is late), and (3) will only trigger consequences expressly approved by the

In response to Indicated PJM TOs’ argument that the Commission lacks the
authority to require RTOs/ISOs to seek cost recovery of study delay penalties from
transmission owners within the RTO/ISO,1961 we note that this concern is moot because
we are declining to adopt the NOPR proposal to require RTOs/ISOs to submit requests to
recover the costs of specific study delay penalties. Further, we modify our proposal to
adopt revisions to 18 CFR section 35.28(f)(1)(ii) to automatically apply study delay
penalties to transmission owners within RTOs/ISOs when those transmission owners
have conducted the delayed studies. Finally, as discussed above, RTOs/ISOs may submit
an FPA section 205 filing to propose a default structure for recovering study delay
penalties or make individual FPA section 205 filings to recover the costs of any specific
study delay penalties.

In response to EEI’s and Eversource’s comments concerning why the good utility
practice standard, which is contained within the text of the definition of the reasonable
efforts standard in the pro forma LGIP, would no longer apply to interconnection
processes,1963 we clarify that the elimination of the reasonable efforts standard does not
eliminate the requirement that transmission providers act consistent with good utility
practice when conducting interconnection studies. Therefore, we adopt revisions to
section 4.2 of the pro forma LGIP to indicate that transmission providers must continue
to conduct interconnection studies consistent with good utility practice.
Some commenters argue that interconnection study deadlines should be extended
in cases of interconnection customer-caused delays and that the timeline for completing
such studies should not restart until after an interconnection customer submits all
necessary information and cures any deficiencies; they also argue that transmission
providers should not be penalized if study delays are caused by a higher-queued cluster
being restudied.1964 We decline to adopt these modifications. As an initial matter, we
note that if an interconnection customer fails to adhere to all requirements in the pro
forma LGIP, except in the case of disputes, the transmission provider shall deem the
interconnection customer’s interconnection request to be withdrawn pursuant to section

FERC, 496 F.3d 695, 703 (D.C. Cir. 2007)).

3.7 of the pro forma LGIP. To the extent that study delays result from an interconnection
customer’s actions or higher-queued cluster restudies, transmission providers may record
the length of those delays and report that information in any appeal of study delay
penalties filed with the Commission.
We disagree with PJM that interconnection customers will be incentivized to delay
studies of their interconnection requests in order to offset their study costs via study delay
penalties being allocated to them from the transmission provider.1965 We agree with AEE
that the economic harms of delaying the interconnection process for an interconnection
customer with a commercially viable interconnection request, especially given the
reforms adopted in this final rule (e.g., increased study deposits, commercial readiness
deposits, and withdrawal penalties) significantly outweigh any economic incentive for
interconnection customers to delay the interconnection process in hopes of a study delay
penalty to offset study costs.1966 For example, a cluster study delayed by 100 business
days would generate $100,000 in study delay penalties to be distributed among all
interconnection customers in the cluster, yet such a lengthy delay could force an
interconnection customer to withdraw from the interconnection queue due to commercial
obligations and carries an interconnection customer withdrawal penalty risk of two times
the study cost.

providers to complete two cluster study cycles before being subject to study delay
penalties, will provide sufficient time for transmission providers to implement the other
reforms adopted in this final rule. This transition mechanism will also give transmission
providers currently undergoing their own interconnection queue reform efforts, as SPP
and NYISO explain they are, time to implement those reforms.1968 In addition, we find
that the study delay penalties are just and reasonable based on the record in this
proceeding and that it would not be appropriate to delay their effect until action is taken
in other proceedings. To the extent the Commission finalizes the proposed reforms in
separate proceedings, the Commission will consider how to address potential interactions
between the reforms adopted in this final rule and elsewhere.

In response to WAPA’s comment that federal agencies should not be subject to
study delay penalties absent a specific Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity,1969
we clarify that the penalties will apply to the extent that a non-public utility has adopted
the proposed penalty provisions as a part of its reciprocity tariff.1970 Under the safe
harbor procedure set out in Order No. 888, non-public utilities may voluntarily submit to
the Commission an open access transmission tariff; if the Commission finds that the tariff
contains terms and conditions that substantially conform or are superior to those in the
pro forma open access transmission tariff, the Commission will deem it an acceptable
reciprocity tariff and will require public utilities to provide open access transmission
service to that particular non-public utility (safe harbor treatment).1971 We find that,
where such non-public utilities voluntarily file a reciprocity tariff, they consent to abide
by the Commission’s open access principles and the various provisions of the pro forma
tariff, which would include the penalties we are adopting in this final rule (unless the

substantially conforms or is superior to the pro forma tariff).1972
WAPA cites to Southwestern Power Admin. v. FERC1973 for its proposition that,
absent a specific waiver of sovereign immunity, federal agencies are not subject to
monetary penalties.1974 We find that case inapposite because the penalties adopted here
are not civil monetary penalties imposed by the Commission and paid to the U.S.
Treasury. Instead, they would be penalties imposed pursuant to a voluntarily submitted
reciprocity tariff and would be distributed to the delayed interconnection customer(s) in
the relevant study that remained in the interconnection queue at the time the penalty
would be distributed. WAPA and other federal agencies, if they file reciprocity tariffs,
would voluntarily choose to abide by the terms of those tariffs and thus would consent to
any penalty structures contained in them.
We decline to adopt commenters’ suggestions to create generic exceptions to
study delay penalties.1975 Not only do we lack record support for some of the

suggestions, but we also believe that transmission provider requests for an exception to a
study delay penalty are best addressed on a case-by-case basis via the appeal process
outlined above.
We decline to adopt alternative proposals suggested by various commenters. For
example, we do not believe that imposing only a reporting requirement on study delays is
sufficient to resolve the problem of interconnection queue backlogs and repeatedly
delayed interconnection studies. Similarly, we decline to condition study delay penalties
on the outcome of a show cause proceeding conducted by the Commission, as suggested
by MISO,1976 because it would be administratively burdensome and may not create a
sufficient incentive for transmission providers to meet interconnection study deadlines.
We also decline to adopt suggestions such as creation of favorable rate treatment for
transmission providers that meet interconnection study deadlines1977 or tying
interconnection study performance to executive compensation,1978 which we do not
believe would ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect in a reliable,
efficient, transparent, and timely manner as effectively as the study delay penalty
structure that we adopt instead.

Affected Systems
a.

Need for Reform
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that the affected system study
process lacks consistency between transmission providers.1979 The Commission stated
that, without any requirement for a timely cost determination, affected system operators
may not return study results in time for interconnection customers to make informed
decisions to facilitate interconnection of their generating facilities. The Commission
added that, due to this lack of information, there may continue to be late-stage
withdrawals resulting from unexpected high costs for affected system network upgrades
that create restudies and delays.1980 The Commission also noted that interconnection
customers recommended standardization of the affected system study process in both the
technical conference in Docket No. AD18-8-000 and in comments on the ANOPR in
Docket No. RM21-17-000, specifically asking for standardization of the timing of study

results, the amount of study costs, and modeling criteria used in affected system
studies.1981
The Commission noted that, currently, detailed information about any two
transmission providers’ affected system study processes is found in multiple transmission
provider documents and is not necessarily cohesive, which appears to create confusion
and uncertainty.1982 The Commission further preliminarily found that, despite these
documents, much of the affected system study process is ad hoc and, therefore, unclear to
interconnection customers. In addition, the Commission explained that affected system
study processes are highly variable based on region and transmission provider, and they
may not be uniform even across a single transmission provider’s footprint.
The Commission preliminarily found that the lack of an affected system study
process results in Commission-jurisdictional rates that are unjust and unreasonable
because an interconnection customer cannot evaluate its costs in a timely manner, which
increases uncertainty and may result in late-stage withdrawals and subsequent restudies,
delays, and increased costs to the remaining interconnection customers in the
interconnection queue.1983 The Commission stated that, without a transparent affected

system study process, it appears that neither an interconnection customer nor the
Commission can evaluate whether the affected system operator has acted in an unduly
discriminatory manner. The Commission further stated that reforms to improve
transparency and coordination, therefore, may be necessary to establish a just, reasonable,
and not unduly discriminatory or preferential affected system study process.

Comments

Multiple commenters generally support action to address the Commission’s
identified need to reform affected system study processes.1984 For example, AEE asserts
that existing affected system study processes are plagued by uncertainty and a lack of
transparency, which, in turn, create delays, interconnection queue withdrawals, and cost
increases.1985 Invenergy, Enel, and SEIA assert that current misalignments in and lack of
coordination of affected system study processes can lead to uncertain, duplicative, or
unexpected study results.1986 Some commenters support synchronization and
harmonization of affected system study processes, with NextEra alleging that study

processes across several regions lack transparency, consistency, coordination, and
accountability, which results in errors and delays.1987 Similarly, Google contends that
current affected system study processes lack deadlines or structure, which exacerbates
anticipating interconnection costs and, in turn, stifles investments.1988 National Grid
asserts that host transmission system and affected system study processes can be
significantly misaligned with project development, investment, and financing timelines
and decision points, resulting in unmanageable risk for interconnection customers.1989
Several commenters highlight the shortcomings of current pro forma LGIP
requirements and their contribution to affected system study process problems.1990 ACENY emphasizes that nothing in the pro forma LGIP binds the affected system study
process, and, as a result, interconnection customers are open to significant impacts and
unreasonable timelines.1991 OMS highlights the limited control that RTOs/ISOs have
regarding the timing of affected system studies.1992 NYISO and Ameren assert that more

specific requirements regarding roles and responsibilities of parties in the affected system
study process are needed.1993 According to Invenergy, the Commission has until now
declined to impose any organized structure around the affected system study process
because affected system network upgrades and associated costs were thought to be a
relatively rare occurrence.1994 Invenergy contends that this has resulted in transmission
providers conducting studies using variable study assumptions and standards and
assigning significant system upgrade costs at any time, even after an interconnecting
generating facility is already in operation.
On the other hand, several commenters doubt whether standardization of affected
system study processes is warranted and argue that adopting the NOPR proposal will
cause timeline problems and delays.1995 SDG&E contends that, based on its experience,
affected system studies infrequently trigger the need for construction of new network
upgrades, and thus it does not find the current process deficient.1996 AECI states that its
current coordination process is not in need of reform because it effectively coordinates

interconnection studies on its deadline).

seams.1997

Commission Determination

We affirm the Commission’s preliminary findings in the NOPR that there is a
compelling need for affected system study process reforms. The record demonstrates
that, absent reforms, affected system studies will likely remain ad hoc, continuing to
create and increase delays in the interconnection process, which leads to increased costs
for both interconnection customers and consumers, thereby failing to ensure just and
reasonable rates. As discussed by commenters, the existing affected system study
processes lack certainty and transparency, which, in turn, create interconnection queue
delays, interconnection customer withdrawals, and cost increases.1998 Affected system
study delays continue to be a major reason for interconnection queue delays.1999 We
concur with commenters that better coordination and more specific requirements
concerning the role and responsibilities of affected system transmission providers are
required to address the lack of certainty and transparency.2000 Additionally, we agree
with commenters that affected system study process reforms will ensure that

interconnection customers are able to connect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and
timely manner.2001 We are unpersuaded by comments that standardizing the affected
system study process will result in timeline problems and delays;2002 we find such claims
to be speculative and contrary to the Commission’s experience with standardizing host
transmission provider study processes via the pro forma LGIP.2003 We discuss specific
aspects of the affected system-related NOPR proposals and final rule determinations
below.
In this final rule, an affected system transmission provider refers to a public utility
transmission provider as the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the rates, terms,
or conditions of service of non-public utility transmission providers. Thus, the
requirements adopted in this final rule pertaining to affected system transmission
providers are limited to public utility transmission providers.

notification, an affected system scoping meeting, a study process, the establishment of
interconnection queue priority for the purposes of network upgrade cost allocation, the
presentation of study results and an assessment of those results, and imposition of
penalties if an affected system transmission provider fails to meet a study deadline. The
Commission also proposed to add several definitions to the pro forma LGIP, including
“affected system interconnection customer,” “affected system network upgrade,”
“affected system scoping meeting,” and “affected system study.”
The Commission proposed to require that the host transmission provider notify the
affected system operator of a potential affected system impact caused by an
interconnection request within 10 business days after the close of the first event giving
rise to the identification of an affected system impact.2005 The Commission explained
that, for host transmission providers using a cluster study process, this event could be (1)
the cluster request window, (2) the customer engagement window, (3) the cluster study,
or (4) the cluster restudy as part of the first-ready, first-served cluster study process. At
the same time that the host transmission provider notifies the affected system operator,
the Commission proposed to require the host transmission provider to provide the
interconnection customer with a list of potential affected systems, along with relevant
contact information. The Commission also proposed to require the host transmission
provider to provide the affected system operator with data on a monthly basis, or more

frequently as needed, about its transmission system and generation in its interconnection
queue for the duration of the affected system study process.
The Commission proposed several requirements on transmission providers acting
as an affected system operator, whose transmission systems may be impacted by the
proposed interconnection of a generating facility to a transmission system other than the
transmission provider’s transmission system.2006 The Commission proposed to require
the affected system transmission provider, within 15 business days of receiving
notification from the host transmission provider of an impact on its transmission system,
to respond in writing indicating whether it intends to perform an affected system study.
The Commission proposed to require that the affected system transmission
provider schedule an affected system scoping meeting within seven business days after
providing written notification that it intends to conduct an affected system study.2007 The
Commission also proposed to require that the affected system scoping meeting be held
within seven business days after it is scheduled. The Commission further proposed to
require that the affected system transmission provider include the affected system
interconnection customer in the scoping meeting and use best efforts to include the
transmission provider with whom interconnection has been requested. The Commission
proposed to require the affected system transmission provider to share the schedule to

complete the affected system study with all scoping meeting attendees within 15 business
days after the close of the scoping meeting.
The Commission proposed to require that the affected system transmission
provider tender an affected system study agreement to the affected system
interconnection customer within five business days of sharing the schedule for the
affected system study.2008 The Commission also proposed to require the affected system
interconnection customer to return the executed affected system study agreement within
10 business days of receipt.
The Commission proposed to require the affected system transmission provider to
use what it referred to as a “first-ready, first-served interconnection queue priority
approach,” which would also determine how affected system network upgrade costs will
be allocated by that transmission provider amongst interconnection customers in separate
transmission systems.2009 Specifically, the Commission explained, in some situations,
both affected system interconnection customers and interconnection customers on the
transmission system of the affected system transmission provider cause the need for
affected system network upgrades; in this case, each interconnection customer’s relative
interconnection queue priority must be determined. The NOPR’s proposed first-ready,
first-served interconnection queue priority approach would require the affected system
transmission provider to assign the affected system interconnection customer a queue

position in its interconnection queue according to when the affected system
interconnection customer executes an affected system study agreement, rather than when
the affected system interconnection customer entered its host transmission provider’s
interconnection queue. The Commission explained that such a position would be
equivalent to that of a transmission provider’s own interconnection customer that had just
received its cluster study report. The Commission also proposed to require the affected
system transmission provider to allocate network upgrade costs among equally queued
interconnection customers using a proportional impact method.
The Commission proposed that the affected system transmission provider must
provide the affected system interconnection customer with affected system study results
within 90 calendar days after the receipt of the executed affected system study
agreement.2010 The Commission proposed to require that the affected system
transmission provider include in the study results both the estimated costs for any
network upgrades identified in the study and the timing for the construction of those
network upgrades.
The Commission proposed to require that the affected system transmission
provider provide the affected system interconnection customer with an affected system
facilities construction agreement within 30 calendar days after providing the affected
system study results.2011 The Commission proposed that the affected system

interconnection customer would then be required to notify the affected system
transmission provider within five business days of executing the generator
interconnection agreement with its host transmission provider whether it would like to
execute the affected system facilities construction agreement or request that it be filed
unexecuted with the Commission. The Commission proposed that the affected system
transmission provider would then be required to execute, or file unexecuted, the affected
system facilities construction agreement within five business days after receiving such
direction from the affected system interconnection customer.
The Commission proposed to impose financial penalties on affected system
transmission providers that fail to timely complete affected system studies.2012 The
Commission explained that a host transmission provider would not be penalized for a late
affected system study and did not require a host transmission provider to wait on the
results of an affected system study to conduct its cluster study, so that any affected
system study delay would not delay such a cluster study. The Commission clarified that
the affected system transmission provider was the only entity that would be penalized for
failure to timely complete an affected system study.

and strict deadlines and will be unworkable.2021 Dominion and SDG&E assert that timing
for affected system studies should not be standardized because the necessary study
assumptions depend on timing of studies in the cluster study process.2022 Dominion
contends that, if an affected system study is performed too early, modeling assumptions
may not yield meaningful results, resulting in incorrect cost estimates likely to cause
restudies and late-stage withdrawals.2023 PJM argues that studying affected system
interconnection requests before all studies have been completed, or studying them for
ERIS, could cause operational problems, require curtailment, or lead to late-stage
withdrawals after the full scope of necessary network upgrades is known.2024 Similarly,
SPP states that, because the NOPR proposal does not prescribe any particular level of
precision for the cost and timing estimates associated with affected system upgrades, the
results received by the interconnection customer could lack sufficient detail and lead to
higher-than-anticipated costs.2025
Several commenters argue that certain elements of the NOPR proposal do not
achieve the goal of increased efficiency.2026 Recognizing that affected system studies

require separate case preparations and a greater level of coordination between parties,
SDG&E agrees with CAISO that the proposal has the potential to increase the number of
affected system studies, with limited benefit.2027 National Grid cautions that
standardizing the affected system study process will necessitate host and affected system
transmission providers to devote more resources to that process, which could cause
delays.2028 PJM contends that, although the NOPR proposal provides that transmission
providers conducting cluster studies are not required to delay those studies by waiting for
the results of affected system studies, such delays will be inevitable under the proposed
process due to the additional steps and coordination required and the overlap in personnel
and deadlines.2029 PJM and National Grid both express concerns regarding the justness
and reasonableness of the NOPR’s penalty regime given the potential for additional
delays in affected system studies.2030
Other commenters argue that the NOPR proposal does not go far enough to
improve efficiency in the affected system study process. North Carolina Commission

WAPA recommends that the Commission consider an alternative strategy in which the
host transmission provider includes contingencies and sensitivity scenarios involving
potentially affected systems in its own studies.2032 PJM suggests that, rather than the
NOPR’s “overly prescriptive” approach, the Commission should require a stated affected
system coordination structure with defined steps and checkpoints, similar to the process
PJM has been working to implement with neighboring systems through its joint operating
agreements.2033

Definitions

PPL argues that the proposed term “affected system interconnection customer” is
confusing and recommends that the Commission either remove “interconnection” or
consider the term “direct connect system customer,” asserting that the affected system
interconnection customers are not interconnection customers working their way through
the affected system transmission provider’s interconnection process.2034 PPL states that
some transmission providers combine interconnection and transmission and argues that
removing the word “interconnection” better accommodates such a combined group.

Several commenters ask for clarification or modification of the terms “affected
system” or “affected system operator.” National Grid asserts that the Commission should
clarify whether an affected system solely includes transmission owners in each region or
also includes neighboring RTOs/ISOs or transmission providers in neighboring
regions.2035 NRECA requests that the Commission clarify the scope of several definitions
so that transmission providers will not overlook a proposed interconnection request’s
impact on an electric cooperative’s affected system.2036

Notification of Affected System
Impacts

Regarding the proposed triggering event at the close of (1) the cluster request
window, (2) the customer engagement window, (3) the cluster study, or (4) the cluster
restudy for a host transmission provider to notify an affected system operator, PacifiCorp
argues that the 10-business day notification obligation begins with an ill-defined standard
in the NOPR—the “close of first event giving rise to the identification of an affected
system impact.”2037 PacifiCorp requests that the Commission clarify this standard and

NRECA Initial Comments at 9, 36-39. More specifically, NRECA contends
that because some transmission providers interpret the definition of “Affected System” to
mean a Commission-jurisdictional transmission system and refuse to recognize that other
electric systems may be affected systems, under the pro forma LGIP and pro forma
LGIA, the Commission should provide that an “Affected System” means any affected
“electric system,” not just an affected “Transmission System,” and that an “Affected
System Operator” means any “entity that operates an Affected System,” not just a
transmission owner or transmission provider. Id. at 36-37, 39.

further clarify that transmission providers will not be penalized if affected system issues
are not discovered until later in the interconnection process, as such impacts may not
always be readily apparent.
Some commenters oppose the proposed requirement in section 3.6.1 of the pro
forma LGIP that a host transmission provider, within 10 business days of the triggering
event that identifies a potential affected system impact, notify an affected system operator
of such potential impact.2038 WAPA states that the initial notification requirement could
unnecessarily increase costs because the notification could be received before the system
impact study on the host transmission provider’s transmission system is complete and
thus before any potential network upgrades are identified. Duke Southeast Utilities assert
that the notification time frame should be 15 business days because: (1) the host
transmission provider may need additional time to notify multiple affected system
operators of a potential impact within the same prescribed time frame; and (2) the host
transmission provider may need additional time to gather all necessary information and
compile adequate notification packages, due to the need to include a technical basis for
the affected system impact.2039 CAISO states that the Commission should require
transmission providers to begin the notification process shortly after interconnection
customers receive their initial study results and face higher financial requirements to

proceed in the interconnection queue.2040 CAISO explains that this is when the majority
of interconnection customers withdraw their interconnection requests because they do not
wish to put more money at risk. CAISO argues that using this smaller pool of
interconnection requests will enable faster affected system studies due to decreased
volume and more realistic study assumptions.
A few commenters provide suggestions on the content of the notice that the host
transmission provider sends to the affected system operator. Specifically, APPA-LPPC
propose that pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1 be revised to include the following: “Along
with notification to Interconnection Customer of the list of potential Affected Systems,
Transmission Provider will notify Interconnection Customer and such Affected Systems
whether a single set of studies (Feasibility, System Impact and Facilities Studies) may be
sufficient to manage all related impacts. A single set of studies may be undertaken upon
agreement of all parties.”2041 Duke Southeast Utilities suggest that, in addition to such
notification, the host transmission provider should provide evidence of the potential
impact, which they assert will assist the affected system operator in: (1) understanding
the host transmission provider’s engineering analysis and assumptions that led it to
identify the potential impact; and (2) determining whether to conduct an affected system
study.2042

Regarding to whom the host transmission provider should send the notification,
NRECA argues that the notification requirement should extend to all potential affected
systems and any affected system operators to allow electric cooperative affected system
transmission providers to coordinate with the transmission provider and interconnection
customer to timely address any affected system impacts.2043 Tri-State states that pro
forma LGIP section 3.6.1 needs clarification as to whom the notice is to be directed.2044
Other commenters oppose the proposed requirement in sections 3.6.2 and 9 of the
pro forma LGIP that affected system transmission providers must respond to the
notification of affected system impacts within 15 business days.2045 Bonneville advocates
that the response time be flexible and allow for reasonable extensions.2046 Bonneville
argues that, if affected system transmission providers only have 15 business days to
respond, they will need to err on the side of caution, which could lead to more affected
system studies than necessary, resulting in study delays. Duke Southeast Utilities assert
that the response time frame should be 20 business days, as the affected system
transmission provider may need additional time if: (1) it has received multiple
notifications within the same time frame; (2) it needs to request additional data to

determine if it intends to perform a study; (3) its own staff is limited because of deadlines
within its own interconnection process; or (4) it wishes to perform a more detailed review
to ensure that performing a study does not become the default approach.2047 Dominion
asserts that a 15-business day requirement could be reasonable if all affected system
notifications were provided at the same time.2048 Dominion contends that piecemeal
notifications make it difficult for an affected system transmission provider to know if an
affected system study is needed until all requests are received.
Additionally, a few commenters contend that the NOPR proposal was unclear
what would happen if an affected system operator fails to respond within 15 business
days. Enel and ENGIE contend that it is unclear what the consequence is for an affected
system transmission provider’s failure to meet the response deadline.2049 Enel
encourages the Commission to add language to the pro forma LGIP to provide that the
affected system transmission provider will forfeit its right to perform an affected system
study if it fails to meet the response deadline, as a lack of incentive (and relevant penalty)
to respond could result in delayed study results.2050 ENGIE suggests that the affected

Timing of Affected System Studies

Several commenters argue that beginning affected system studies too early may
yield unreliable results that could lead to restudies and late-stage withdrawals, among
other problems.2053 NextEra asserts that it is unlikely that the host transmission provider
could provide useful information to the affected system transmission provider at an
earlier stage.2054 CAISO and Idaho Power argue that the proposal to begin the affected
system study process as soon as potential impacts are identified will slow affected system
studies or result in unnecessary work for the affected system transmission provider
because the impacts will be assessed based on transmission providers’ entire
interconnection queues, even though many interconnection customers will withdraw early
in the interconnection process.2055

CAISO takes issue with the proposed deadlines for completing affected system
studies and claims that the size of modern interconnection queues makes such quick
deadlines impossible. According to CAISO, such deadlines would result in all affected
system transmission providers exercising their rights to study every interconnection
customer because they have no time to determine whether studies are necessary.2056
Invenergy argues that affected system transmission providers should be subject to
a deadline for participation in the process.2057
Invenergy asserts that, although the NOPR clearly provides that a host
transmission provider is not required to pause its interconnection process if an affected
system transmission provider does not timely complete its study, the reality is that this
could leave interconnection customers in the same position they are in now—being
forced under the host transmission provider’s timeline to move forward in the study
process and to execute an LGIA (and put money at risk) without the benefit of affected
system study results. Invenergy contends that the solution is to establish a clear deadline
(e.g., LGIA execution) by which time the affected system transmission provider must
have completed its studies and identified affected system network upgrades; otherwise, it
loses any right to assign affected system network upgrades to an interconnection request
in the future. Invenergy states that, if the Commission does not impose such a deadline,
it should at least permit interconnection customers that have been forced under host

transmission provider’s rules to execute LGIAs in the absence of affected system study
information to: (1) delay posting security and funding network upgrades under that
LGIA until the affected system study results are received; and (2) have the opportunity to
withdraw without penalty after receiving affected system study results if the
interconnection customer’s assigned costs increased by more than 25% compared to costs
allocated by the host transmission provider.2058
Several commenters argue that an affected system study timeline should be
consistent with the cluster study process on the host transmission provider’s transmission
system because it can impact the host transmission provider’s study.2059 APS requests
additional clarification on how the proposed affected system study process correlates to
the host system studies and aligns with the host system’s requirements.2060 Enel
acknowledges that the 90-calendar day affected system study deadline may be
problematic for transmission providers that have 150 calendar days to run the same scope
of studies for their own interconnection requests.2061 AEP stresses the need for
coordination between these studies, which it argues would provide the interconnection
customer with a more meaningful cost estimate, with coordination resulting in affected

system and host system study results being presented around the same time.2062 Enel
contends that the affected system transmission provider should be required to complete
any affected system impact studies no later than the host transmission provider’s deadline
to complete the cluster restudy.2063 Enel asserts that this initial affected system study
should be completed before the interconnection customer must satisfy requirements to
enter the facilities study, at which point the interconnection customer faces a higher
withdrawal penalty. Enel contends that the NOPR proposal could result in an affected
system transmission provider being notified that an affected system study is needed after
final results of the cluster restudy are complete, meaning that an affected system study
may not be completed until or even after the execution of an LGIA. Enel argues that,
after affected system studies are complete, an interconnection customer could have its
costs double just before (or even after) an LGIA is executed, and penalty-free withdrawal
under proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.7.1 would only apply if assigned
interconnection costs increase by more than 100%.
Several commenters argue that the timing of affected system studies should be
structured to reduce potential burdens. Idaho Power suggests that affected system studies
be performed after the initial cluster study to minimize unnecessary work and ensure that
only interconnection requests moving into the cluster restudy have their affected system

Affected System Scoping Meeting

Several commenters express concern about the proposed requirement in section
3.6.2 of the pro forma LGIP that the affected system transmission provider (1) schedule
an affected system scoping meeting within seven business days after providing written
notification that it intends to conduct an affected system study and (2) hold that meeting
within seven business days after it is scheduled.2066 Bonneville and Dominion assert that
holding the scoping meeting within this time frame might not be realistic because these
meetings are contingent upon the availability of multiple attendees.2067 CAISO contends
that the proposal to schedule affected system scoping meetings within seven business
days is impossible and that affected system transmission providers would simply hold
scoping meetings to comply, having had no time to prepare anything meaningful for the

providers to develop their own schedule for the scoping process rather than mandating a

with joint operating and/or planning agreements, which MISO claims should be able to
justify their existing procedures on compliance via the independent entity variation
standard. Bonneville emphasizes flexibility and proposes that the phrase “unless
otherwise agreed to” be added to this requirement.2070
Pacific Northwest Utilities state that, provided that regulated utilities properly
invite the non-jurisdictional affected system transmission provider to the affected system
scoping meeting, the Commission should clarify that such steps are sufficient to
demonstrate that the regulated transmission provider has met its requirements under this
section.2071 Further, Pacific Northwest Utilities note that the non-jurisdictional affected
system transmission provider is not required to respond to the requirements under section

Affected System Study Process

Multiple commenters advocate for changes to the proposed requirement in section
3.6.3 of the pro forma LGIP that the transmission provider provide data monthly, or more
frequently as needed, regarding the amount and location of generation in the transmission
provider’s interconnection queue, as well as updated information about the transmission
provider’s transmission system. NRECA states that the proposed information sharing
requirement is essential but should not be limited to notifying or providing data to a
transmission provider acting as an affected system operator but should extend to all
potential affected systems and any affected system operators to allow electric cooperative
affected system operators to perform studies and coordinate with the transmission
provider and interconnection customer to timely address any affected system impact.2072
MISO argues that the Commission should not impose an arbitrary time frame for data
reports and suggests that such information should be provided only at times when it
changes.2073 MISO asserts that updates are not likely to be helpful to interconnection
customers until the next study stage has been completed. NV Energy requests that the
Commission move to quarterly reporting because monthly updates would not be helpful
and may provide dramatic swings in study results, which could trigger the need for an
affected system study to start over.2074 NV Energy also requests that assumptions for

studies be coordinated between the host transmission provider and affected system
operator and that updates become quarterly after the study has been issued.
LADWP requests clarification as to what specific data “updated information about
the transmission provider’s transmission system” refers.2075
Bonneville and Dominion argue that the proposed information sharing
requirement is duplicative or unnecessary. Bonneville posits that the requirement is
duplicative of information that is already available on OASIS.2076 Dominion argues that
this requirement is overly cumbersome given transmission providers’ limited resources
and numerous obligations and may produce data that the affected system may not even
want or use.2077 Dominion asserts that it would be more efficient to require the host
transmission provider to provide such information upon request.

affected system studies conform to the NOPR’s proposed approach and are an equitable
means for sharing costs for network upgrades amongst interconnection customers in
different regions and encourages timely processing of affected system impacts.2079
However, Bonneville and NextEra assert that the NOPR does not adequately
address the important issue of queue priority coordination.2080 NextEra argues that the
notion of interconnection customers racing to be the first (or perhaps the last) to sign an
affected system study agreement as a way of setting queue priority will result in
conflict.2081 NextEra contends that, instead, the goal should be to ensure that
transmission providers acting as affected systems perform affected system studies on a
timeline that is consistent with the host transmission system’s stated schedule so that
results are delivered in a timely manner and interconnection customers can be wellinformed in their decision making. NextEra recommends that each pair of transmission
providers whose interconnection customers affect each other’s system enter into
agreements, to be filed with the Commission, specifying how they will ensure appropriate
queue priority in affected system studies.
Bonneville argues that the queue priority for affected system interconnection
requests should be determined by giving priority to an interconnection request in an

affected system study over any interconnection request that has not yet started the cluster
study on the host transmission system.2082 Bonneville contends that if an affected system
interconnection request receives higher queue priority relative to any interconnection
requests for which the host transmission provider has started the cluster study but has not
yet provided cluster study reports, then such a queue priority framework would introduce
uncertainty into the cluster study process, as an affected system notification could be
received during the cluster study process and trigger a restudy, delays, and increased
costs to the participants of the cluster study.
Other commenters argue for different approaches to affected system queue priority
or allocation of affected system network upgrade costs. ENGIE argues that, although
assigning an affected system queue position appears beneficial for assigning network
upgrade costs, it could also create delays for the interconnection customer because it
would be beholden to two separate interconnection queues.2083 ENGIE recommends that
the Commission allocate network upgrade costs outside of the interconnection queue on
an ex post basis to avoid the double-queue situation.
Enel asserts that the NOPR’s proposed queue priority determination method will
result in additional uncertainty about timing of affected system studies, incomplete and
inaccurate cluster study results, and the need for restudies.2084 Although Enel agrees that

establishing queue priority between host and affected system interconnection requests is
essential, Enel disagrees with the NOPR proposal to establish the affected system
interconnection request’s queue priority according to when the affected system
interconnection customer executes an “affected system study.”2085 Enel states that this
must be a typo that should say “affected system study agreement.” Enel also notes that
proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.2 does not clearly state which event establishes the
date by which an affected system interconnection request receives its queue priority
relative to host system interconnection requests and requests clarification on this
point.2086 Enel further states that, if affected system queue priority is established based
on an individual date, transmission providers would need to process affected system
interconnection requests serially rather than by cluster and recommends that the
Commission adopt a queue priority framework in which affected system interconnection
requests would be studied in the same cluster grouping that the host transmission
provider uses.2087 Enel also recommends that queue priority be assigned based on the
deadline for entry into the host transmission provider’s interconnection queue.

interconnection queue priority approach interacts with cluster studies.2088 EDF
Renewables recommends that, to better synchronize the host and affected system study
processes, the affected system operator should establish queue priority between the host
and affected system based on the interconnection request achieving a certain stage in the
host system’s study process, rather than the date the interconnection request was
submitted.2089 APPA-LPPC ask that the Commission clarify proposed pro forma LGIP
section 9.2 and the related obligations under pro forma LGIP sections 9.8 and 4.2.3.2090
APPA-LPPC state that, as drafted, proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.2 suggests a queue
position for an interconnection customer independent of ongoing and pending cluster
studies while pro forma LGIP section 9.8 and cross-referenced pro forma LGIP section
4.2.3 contemplate the allocation of associated costs incurred by affected systems in the
context of a cluster study.
Additionally, MISO recommends that the final rule clarify an enforcement
mechanism, such as loss of relative queue priority used under the MISO-SPP joint
operating agreement, for the proposed first-ready, first-served interconnection queue
priority approach.2091

Affected System Study Agreement

Dominion and Duke Southeast Utilities suggest doubling the amount of time that
transmission providers would have under proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.3 to tender
an affected system study agreement after sharing the schedule for the affected system
study.2092 Duke Southeast Utilities assert that it usually takes more than five business
days to receive all needed interconnection request information to draft an affected system
study agreement (an often iterative process).2093 Duke Southeast Utilities state that more
time will help affected system transmission providers that may need to draft numerous
affected system study agreements within the same time frame.
Bonneville requests clarification as to whether the failure to execute the affected
system study agreement, execute the affected system facilities construction agreement, or
provide the affected system study deposit would be grounds for removal from the host
transmission provider’s interconnection queue.2094

Several commenters request that the Commission explicitly include a facilities
study in the affected system study process.2097 Duke Southeast Utilities, Enel, NV
Energy, and SPP assert that explicitly including a facilities study in the affected system
study process would provide both affected system transmission provider and affected

pricing network upgrades and other facilities necessary to mitigate transmission-related

it does not intend to foreclose the possibility of affected system facilities studies being
conducted, as a facilities study is needed to ascertain the precise nature of any network
upgrades that an interconnection customer may cause.2101
Shell argues for including further information regarding local transmission
planning from neighboring transmission providers in affected system study results
because early identification of all transmission-related mitigation will ensure that
interconnection customers can anticipate affected system network upgrades as early as
possible.2102
Several commenters, including transmission providers, argue that the 90-calendar
day time frame for completion of the affected system study, from the date an affected
system transmission provider receives an executed affected system study agreement from
the affected system interconnection customer to the date the affected system transmission
provider presents the affected system study report to the affected system interconnection

clock would commence only after all necessary data has been received.2106
Other commenters support the NOPR proposal or argue that affected system
interconnection customers should be given the results of affected system studies as early
as possible. Interwest states that it agrees with commenters that the proposed 90-calendar
day time limit, combined with monetary penalties, will help instill discipline and support
investments needed to meet the timelines.2107 Shell asserts that affected system study
results must be provided before or in conjunction with system impact study results on the
host transmission system, or at the latest, before interconnection customers are required
to proceed to the facilities study on the host transmission system, as interconnection
customers typically pursue financing after receiving system impact study results and
before advancing to the facilities study and doing so will avoid last minute network
upgrade costs that undermine project viability and cause interconnection queue
withdrawals.2108 Shell supports an option for interconnection customers to pause the
interconnection study process on the host transmission system for an affected system

should be permitted to delay posting security and funding network upgrades, if there are
delays in affected system studies, which Interwest contends is a reasonable
accommodation that allows such affected system interconnection customers to reduce
risks.2109
Additionally, WAPA expresses concern about its ability to tender an affected

penalties for late affected system studies.2112
MISO, in contrast, interprets the NOPR proposal as applying penalties only to the
affected system transmission provider, and recommends that the Commission recognize
that some delays may be beyond the control of the affected system transmission provider
and not penalize affected system transmission providers for third-party delays.2113
Similarly, Duke Southeast Utilities express concern that penalties could be levied against
affected system transmission providers for delays beyond their control, and further argue
that the Commission should consider imposing multilateral penalties on all entities in
accordance with their individual obligations set forth in the proposed process.2114

Commission should allow penalty-free withdrawals in the event of late affected system
network upgrade costs that surpass a certain threshold, arguing that such circumstances
are beyond the interconnection customer’s control.2116 PacifiCorp states that any cost
estimates identified by affected system operators should be non-binding, given that they
could be subject to change.2117
Pattern Energy believes that the Commission should provide incentives for
transmission providers to provide more reasonable and accurate cost estimates for
network upgrades and related facilities, even for affected system studies.2118 Pattern

customers to share the cost and, in doing so, reduce the likelihood of cascading
withdrawals.2119
Other commenters stress the importance of certainty and fairness in cost allocation
rules. For example, National Grid contends that cost allocation rules should provide
certainty to interconnection customers at a reasonable point in the interconnection
process, while also having appropriate rules to allocate changes in cost allocations that
arise after the date that network upgrade costs are finalized.2120 National Grid suggests
that this could be achieved by finalizing network upgrade cost allocations at the facilities
study phase of the host transmission provider’s interconnection study process, subject to
risk sharing cost allocation rules, whereby later changes due to the identification of
additional required facilities could be shared between the interconnection customer and
load in a transmission provider’s footprint based on the principle of beneficiary pays,
through various particular methodologies, including those used for transmission planning
upgrades or those based on geography.2121
Finally, several commenters raise other issues regarding affected system cost
allocation. Enel seeks clarity regarding whether shared network upgrades would apply

requests.2122 NV Energy asserts that, since the affected system interconnection request is
queued, if the affected system interconnection customer is allocated affected system
network upgrade costs based on the proportional impact method and subsequentially
withdraws, then a restudy could potentially be required for a lower-queued cluster, which
would result in a misalignment with the timeline and withdrawal penalties in the
transmission provider’s cluster study for native interconnection requests.2123 ACE-NY
argues that no project should be assigned affected system network upgrade costs after it
executes its LGIA and/or after the interconnection customer has accepted its cost
allocation in the class year process in NYISO.2124

transmission provider to tender an affected system facilities construction agreement to the

Idaho Power suggests that the affected system transmission provider tender the affected
system facilities construction agreement either within 60 calendar days after the
interconnection customers executes a facilities construction agreement with the host
transmission provider or within 30 calendar days after providing the affected system
study results to the affected system interconnection customer, if the affected system study
is performed during the interconnection facilities study.2126 Idaho Power explains that
information required in the facilities construction agreement is comparable to the
information provided by the host transmission provider in the interconnection facilities
study report, which, according to Idaho Power, provides a reasonably accurate timing and
cost estimate and requires considerable coordination to develop. WAPA highlights other
constraints, stating that it contracts out many of its facilities study tasks, which can take
significant time, that it must work within the budgetary constraints of its annual
appropriation, and that it is impractical to have a construction agreement ready for any
interconnection customer within 30 calendar days.2127
MISO cautions that providing detailed affected system network upgrade cost
estimates and construction timelines within 30 calendar days of providing the affected
system study results may not be feasible given that MISO currently only gives high-level

necessary construction schedule, and the potential for more information and updates from
the host transmission provider).

cost estimates after its affected system study and construction timelines and detailed cost
estimates are provided in the affected system network upgrade facilities study, which is
performed by transmission owners.2128 MISO further argues that it should not be
responsible for actions that are beyond its control, such as the transmission ownerprepared affected system network upgrade facilities study, which it claims would not be
feasible to include in each affected system study report if it is attempting to meet the 90calendar day study timeline, and thus the affected system study and the affected system
facilities study should be kept separate. MISO further argues that it is unlikely that
transmission owners could provide cost/schedule detail with +/- 20% accuracy within 30
calendar days of determination of affected system network upgrade obligations, with 90
calendar days being a more reasonable time frame.2129

Several commenters argue that transmission providers should process affected
system studies using a clustering approach.2131 Several commenters argue that mandating
use of serial studies for all variously situated transmission providers would adversely
impact the efficiency of the study process and place a significant administrative burden
on transmission providers that is disproportionate to the contemplated benefits.2132

when cluster studies of affected system impacts will be more expeditious and efficient,
contending that this would particularly be the case when interconnection requests in large

Some commenters recommend that the Commission adopt the coordination approach

provider coordinates all technical data, study deposits, and studies with the affected
system transmission provider rather than the proposed direct communication and
coordination between interconnection customer and affected system transmission
provider.2141 Enel asserts that this would reduce administrative burden, ensure timely

Enel also argues that using the host transmission provider’s study agreement to require
the interconnection customer to comply with the affected system transmission provider’s
study process ensures that the interconnection customer must meet tariff deadlines and
cannot delay the affected system transmission provider’s studies. In addition, Shell states
that that the Commission should develop guidance for situations in which neighboring
transmission providers disagree on the scope and/or timing of an affected system
study.2142
Several commenters argue that the NOPR proposal should be reevaluated or
modified regarding whether and when transmission providers conducting cluster studies
would be required to delay those studies to wait for the results of affected system studies.
Pattern Energy contends that the Commission should consider an approach in which host
transmission providers are not required to wait for affected system studies to be
completed, if such delayed action would result in a study milestone being missed.2143
Pattern Energy seeks to avoid an unintentional “delay loop,” whereby the affected system

host transmission providers should be required to share the interconnection customer’s
technical data as needed. Enel reasons that through direct connections, host and affected
system transmission providers would be better able to compare constraints and proposed
upgrades to coordinate where a single upgrade may address constraints on both
transmission systems. Id.

provider is waiting for it.2144
In contrast, PacifiCorp requests that the Commission clarify that, although host
transmission providers performing cluster studies are not required to delay those studies
by waiting for the results of affected system studies, transmission providers will not be
prohibited from delaying the cluster study process to account for affected system study
issues if the host transmission provider determines that the cluster study cannot progress
without the results of the affected system studies.2145 MISO raises similar concerns about
a transmission provider proceeding with its cluster studies without affected system data,
which it asserts is critical information for an interconnection customer.2146 MISO further
asserts that the NOPR proposal will not provide useful information to the interconnection
customer sooner and will increase uncertainty, opportunities for late-stage withdrawals,
cost shifts, and unscheduled restudies and cascading withdrawals.2147

RTO/ISO regions have operating agreements that address interface capacity rights and
processes to relieve congestion near and across seams, Xcel argues that host and affected

considering any interconnection-related requirements from the affected system
transmission provider.
APPA-LPPC request that transmission providers be able to forego a formal
affected system study when studies by the host transmission provider may be
sufficient.2149 APPA-LPPC ask the Commission to recognize in the pro forma LGIP that
there may be instances in which separate affected system studies may not be necessary or
useful because, in their members’ experience, particularly in the Western
Interconnection, feasibility, system impact, and facilities studies undertaken by a directly
interconnecting transmission provider may be adequate in scope to encompass impacts on
and any necessary upgrades to an affected system.2150 In such a case, APPA-LPPC state,
a unitary study would be less expensive for all parties and avoid a complex administrative
task of sequencing and integrating separate system studies.2151

Another alternative proposed by WAPA and Enel is the use of an affected system
screening process to identify instances where affected system studies will be needed.2152
WAPA suggests that this screening process could be a feasibility-level study, completed
for an entire cluster, to narrow down which interconnection requests within the cluster
potentially have impacts on an affected system.2153 WAPA contends that, without a
screening process, transmission providers under the NOPR proposal will require affected
system studies by default. Enel suggests that the affected system transmission provider
should conduct the screening process during the host transmission provider’s cluster
study so that the affected system transmission provider is prepared to perform its affected
system study during the host transmission provider’s initial cluster restudy.

Interregional Transmission Planning

A few commenters urge the Commission to address affected system impacts as a
systematic phenomenon and a matter of interregional transmission planning, rather than
one-off events to be handled serially.2154 EDF Renewables argues that better
interregional transmission planning should reduce the frequency and severity of affected
system impacts, asserting that a system-wide approach is more efficient than a piecemeal

NOPR is that the costs for alleviating an existing system condition should not rest with a
new generating facility interconnecting on an adjacent system that did not create the
problem.2156 NextEra argues that preexisting reliability issues should instead be
identified and solved through the transmission planning processes.

Idaho Power requests clarification regarding whether the affected system study
process would be required for entities that already use the first-ready, first served cluster
study process.2157
Regarding timing, Invenergy argues that although many of the NOPR’s proposed
requirements should apply prospectively to new interconnection requests, immediate
action from the Commission is needed to resolve affected system issues. Invenergy
requests that the Commission clarify that the proposed reforms should apply to all
pending interconnection requests and active studies.2158

Similarly, NYTOs request that the Commission clarify that the proposed affected system
reforms would not apply to neighboring transmission owners within a single RTO/ISO,
or at least allow such transmission owners to demonstrate on compliance that their
existing processes already address such intra-RTO/ISO issues.2161 AEP requests that the
Commission address what it terms the four primary types of affected system scenarios:
neighboring transmission owner systems within one RTO/ISO; neighboring transmission
owner systems in two separate RTOs/ISOs; a transmission owner system in an RTO/ISO
neighboring a non-RTO/ISO transmission provider; and neighboring transmission
providers both outside of an RTO/ISO.2162 AEP contends that the Commission appears to
conflate all possible affected system scenarios in the NOPR, even though the nature of
any affected system study can be impacted by the type of scenario.2163

Commission has allowed states to retain their historic interconnection jurisdiction under
PURPA where the QF sells its entire net output to the interconnecting utility.2165 CREA
and NewSun argue, though, that where affected system issues are involved, the state’s
jurisdiction over the sale of the QF’s energy to a utility regulated by that state would not
extend to affected system issues with a third-party transmission provider that is not
purchasing the QF’s net output.2166 CREA and NewSun urge the Commission to clarify
that a QF interconnection customer has the option to opt into use of the Commission’s
interconnection procedures, in cases where the interconnection requires studies or
network upgrades on an affected system without loss of queue position. CREA and
NewSun also argue that the QF should retain the right to elect to proceed through the
state process in case the QF concludes that it would be less disruptive to do so.

reforms apply to non-Commission-jurisdictional transmission providers.2167 Invenergy

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modifications, the NOPR proposal to establish an affected system
study process in, and add several related definitions to, the pro forma LGIP. As
explained in the NOPR, a detailed affected system study process in the pro forma LGIP
will prevent the use of ad hoc approaches that may give rise to interconnection customers

manner. We agree with commenters that it will also provide interconnection customers
greater certainty regarding expectations throughout the interconnection process, including
greater cost certainty, which will lead to fewer late-stage withdrawals and fewer delays.
The firm affected system study deadlines will also ensure that the affected system study
process moves along expediently, providing clarity, cost certainty, and increased
transparency throughout the study process, which will minimize opportunities for undue
discrimination. For these reasons, we find that the affected system study process reforms
adopted herein are just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential and that
they remedy the unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential rates
resulting from the status quo with regard to affected systems. We further find that such
reforms will ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the
transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.
We disagree with commenters’ concerns that a broadly applied, prescriptive
affected system study process may not be helpful or may be unworkable.2175 Instead, we
agree with National Grid that the current status quo is not working and will likely worsen
absent intervention.2176 Although some transmission providers may already have
working affected system study processes in place, many do not, creating uncertainty and
unreasonable delay in the interconnection process. Further, as discussed below with

regard to specific reforms, we adopt several revisions to the NOPR proposal in response
to comments to ensure the affected system study process deadlines are reasonable and
support efficient processing of interconnection requests. We disagree with commenters
who argue that the NOPR proposal does not increase efficiency and note that certain
modifications will further increase efficiency.2177 While certain required steps in the
affected system study process may increase the need for communication and coordination
between affected system transmission providers, affected system interconnection
customers, and/or host transmission providers, we find that the potential burden of such
discrete efforts are outweighed by the efficiencies of a standardized and more predictable
affected system study process. We further find that defining an affected system study
process in the pro forma LGIP is necessary to ensure that affected system interconnection
customers are not being treated in an unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or
preferential manner, and to ensure that they can evaluate their costs and make decisions
regarding the viability of their generation facilities in a timely manner during the
interconnection study process.

Definitions and Applicability (Pro Forma
LGIP Sections 1 and 9.1)

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to include several definitions in
section 1 of the pro forma LGIP related to the affected system reforms, specifically,
“affected system facilities construction agreement,” “affected system interconnection

customer,” “affected system network upgrades,” “affected system study,” “affected
system study agreement,” and “affected system study report.” We find these terms to be
necessary to enumerate the affected system transmission provider’s responsibilities in the
affected system study process.2178 We also add the terms “multiparty affected system
study agreement” and “multiparty affected system facilities construction agreement” to
section 1 of the pro forma LGIP in light of our adoption of such agreements as part of
this final rule, as discussed below. We also add the term “affected system queue
position” to the pro forma LGIP because we find it helpful to distinguish between an
interconnection customer’s queue position on the host system versus its queue position on
an affected system.
We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal to add section 9.1 to the pro
forma LGIP, titled “Applicability.” We find that pro forma LGIP section 9.1 clarifies
that the transmission provider’s obligations in section 9 apply when it is acting as an
affected system transmission provider, and we have added clarifying language to resolve
ambiguity therein.2179

2178

We note that, in the affected system context, there are certain instances in
which we intentionally use lowercase versions of defined terms to deviate from their
definitions in section 1 of the pro forma LGIP. For example, “generating facility” is, in
pro forma LGIP section 1, part of the definition of “affected system interconnection
customer.” In the affected system context, we are referring to a generating facility
governed by another transmission provider’s LGIP rather than the affected system
transmission provider’s generating facility as defined in its own LGIP.
2179

We note that former pro forma LGIP section 9, titled “Engineering and
Procurement (‘E&P’) Agreement,” is now pro forma LGIP section 13.7 to accommodate
the new affected system study process section.

In response to PPL’s argument that the term “affected system interconnection
customer” is confusing and that either another term should be used or “interconnection”
should be deleted from the term, we reiterate that the pro forma LGIP is written to apply
to all transmission providers on a generic basis, meaning transmission providers studying
proposed interconnections to their transmission systems (host transmission providers) as
well as transmission providers studying the impacts on their own transmission system of
proposed interconnections to other transmission providers’ transmission systems
(affected system transmission providers). In other words, when a transmission provider’s
transmission system is an affected system, the interconnection customer creating the
affected system impact is different from that particular affected system transmission
provider’s own interconnection customers (i.e., those that propose to interconnect directly
to the transmission provider’s transmission system) and must be distinguished
accordingly in the pro forma LGIP. The term “affected system interconnection
customer” achieves this goal by distinguishing between the interconnection customer’s
dual roles in the host transmission provider’s study process and the affected system
transmission provider’s study process.
Further, we disagree with PPL’s assertion that some transmission providers
combine interconnection and transmission processes, making “interconnection” an
unnecessary distinction.2180 This proceeding involves generic generator interconnection
procedures, pursuant to which transmission service request studies are performed

independently from interconnection studies.2181 However, we modify the definition of
“affected system interconnection customer” and use other defined terms in the pro forma
LGIP for additional clarity and consistency.
As explained below, we do not adopt the NOPR proposal to require an affected
system scoping meeting and therefore also do not adopt the proposed term “affected
system scoping meeting” in section 1 of the pro forma LGIP.
We clarify that the terms “affected system” and “affected system operator” retain
their existing definitions in pro forma LGIP section 1.2182
In response to NRECA’s request for clarification, we reiterate that the final rule
applies to transmission providers and, in the affected system context, to transmission
providers that are acting as affected systems per the pro forma LGIP definition.
Therefore, we decline to expand the scope of several affected systems-related definitions
as requested by NRECA because we find NRECA’s request to be outside the scope of
this proceeding.2183 In response to National Grid’s request for clarification regarding
whether an affected system solely includes transmission owners in each region or also

See Tenn. Power Co., 90 FERC ¶ at 61,761 (finding that interconnection is an
element of transmission service but that the interconnection component of transmission
service may be requested separately from the delivery component (i.e., interconnection is
distinct from transmission service)).
2182

An affected system is an electric system other than the transmission provider’s
transmission system that may be affected by the proposed interconnection. An affected
system operator is the entity that operates an affected system. Pro forma LGIP section 1.

includes neighboring RTOs/ISOs or transmission providers in neighboring regions, we
reiterate that an affected system is defined in section 1 of the pro forma LGIP as an
electric system other than the transmission provider’s transmission system that may be
affected by the proposed interconnection.
(b)

Identification and Notification of Affected
Systems (Pro Forma LGIP Sections 3.6.1, 9.2,
and 11.2.1)

We adopt, with modification, proposed section 3.6.1 of the pro forma LGIP,
which sets forth the trigger events for identification of an affected system impact to begin
the affected system study process. We modify that section to retain as trigger events the
completion of the cluster study and cluster restudy but eliminate the earlier trigger
events—the close of the cluster request window and the close of the customer
engagement window. While we would expect identification of potential affected system
impacts to occur upon the completion of the cluster study, we recognize that an affected
system impact may not be identified until a restudy occurs, and we adopt language in pro
forma LGIP section 3.6.1 to account for such a scenario. Thus, as adopted in pro forma
LGIP section 3.6.1, we require the transmission provider to notify the affected system
operator at the first instance of an identified potential affected system impact, which may
occur at the completion of the (1) cluster study or (2) cluster restudy. We also move the
affected system transmission provider’s obligations to respond to the initial notification
under proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1 to a new pro forma LGIP section 9.2. We
find this bifurcation of duties with respect to initial affected system notification for the
transmission provider, when acting as host transmission provider and affected system

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 730 -

transmission provider, appropriately sets forth the responsibilities of the transmission
provider in the sections describing the conditions for each action.
We also adopt the provision proposed in pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1 that
provides for the transmission provider to notify an affected system operator of a potential
affected system impact caused by the interconnection request within 10 business days of
the first trigger event giving rise to the identification of the affected system impact. We
modify the provision in proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1 for the affected system
transmission provider to respond to such notification in writing within 15 business days
indicating whether it intends to conduct an affected system study to 20 business days,
which we move to pro forma LGIP section 9.2, as noted above. We further move to pro
forma LGIP section 9.2 the requirement that, within 15 business days of the affected
system transmission provider’s affirmative response of its intent to conduct an affected
system study, the affected system transmission provider must share a non-binding good
faith estimate of the cost and schedule to complete the affected system study.
As adopted, the identification and notification process is tied to the completion of
the cluster study or the cluster restudy. At that point, the host transmission provider will
have a stronger basis for deciding whether an interconnection request will potentially
impact an affected system. Further, the initiation of the affected system study process
after the initial study costs are received should lead to affected system study results that
provide greater cost certainty, as the largest number of interconnection request
withdrawals will most likely occur after receipt of the initial cluster study results, a point

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 731 -

noted by commenters.2184 After receipt of the initial cluster study results, those
interconnection requests remaining in the host system’s interconnection queue are more
likely to complete the interconnection study process. We agree with CAISO that this
smaller pool of affected system interconnection customers will enable faster affected
system studies due to a decreased volume of affected system interconnection customers
and more realistic study assumptions.2185 Accordingly, we find that beginning the
affected system study process after the adopted trigger events provides greater certainty
to interconnection customers regarding affected system network upgrade costs while
ensuring a faster affected system study process. This is because the affected system
transmission provider will be using more realistic study assumptions and studying a more
realistic number of affected system interconnection customers, reducing the need for
restudy.
We find that notification to an affected system operator of a potential impact prior
to receipt of cluster study results would be administratively burdensome and inefficient
and could potentially slow the interconnection process because such notification would
include numerous interconnection requests that ultimately do not reach commercial
operation.2186

In eliminating the first two notification triggers, we recognize that the affected
system study process will start later and, as a result, the interconnection customer could
be required to execute, or request to be filed unexecuted, its LGIA before it has received
its affected system study results and cost estimates for any affected system network
upgrades. To avoid this result and in response to commenters’ requests that transmission
providers should be given the option to wait for affected system study results when
conducting cluster studies,2187 we modify the NOPR proposal and add a new section
11.2.1 to the pro forma LGIP. Under this section, if the interconnection customer does
not receive its affected system study results pursuant to pro forma LGIP section 9.7,
discussed below, before the deadline for LGIA execution, or the deadline to request that
the LGIA be filed unexecuted, in its host system, the host transmission provider must, at
the interconnection customer’s request, delay the deadline for the interconnection
customer to finalize its LGIA.2188 The interconnection customer will have 30 calendar
days after receipt of the affected system study report to execute the LGIA, or request that
the LGIA be filed unexecuted.
As noted above, we find that by adopting pro forma LGIP section 11.2.1, we
ensure that interconnection customers have adequate time to evaluate their costs prior to
committing to the cost estimates contained in an LGIA. Additionally, if the

Any interconnection customer that is not awaiting the results of an affected
system study must proceed under the timelines set forth in pro forma LGIP section 11.1.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

interconnection customer prefers to proceed to the execution of its LGIA, or request that
the LGIA be filed unexecuted, before it has received its affected system study results, it
may notify the host transmission provider of its intent to proceed with the execution of
the LGIA, or request that the LGIA be filed unexecuted. If the host transmission
provider determines that further delay to the LGIA execution date would cause a material
impact on the cost or timing of an equal- or lower-queued interconnection customer, the
transmission provider must notify the interconnection customer whose deadline to
execute the LGIA, or request that the LGIA be filed unexecuted, is delayed of such
impact and establish that the new deadline is 30 calendar days after such notice is
provided.
In response to ACE-NY’s argument that no interconnection customer should be
assigned affected system network upgrade costs after it executes its LGIA and/or after the
interconnection customer has accepted its cost allocation in the class year process in
NYISO,2189 we decline to rule on specific transmission provider processes in this final
rule. We note, however, that, under new pro forma LGIP section 11.2.1, interconnection
customers may negotiate LGIA execution to await an affected system study report for
greater certainty at the time of LGIA execution, or requesting the LGIA to be filed
unexecuted, if that further delay to the LGIA execution date would not cause a material
impact on the cost or timing of an equal- or lower-queued interconnection customer.

We decline to require the affected system transmission provider to provide
affected system study results before the facilities study phase, as asserted by Enel and
Shell,2190 because such a requirement would necessitate that the affected system
transmission provider would have to begin such studies before any interconnection
customers withdraw from the interconnection queue and would therefore involve the
study of numerous interconnection requests that do not eventually proceed to commercial
operation, resulting in additional restudies and delays.
In response to Tri-State’s argument that proposed pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1
needs to clarify to whom notice is to be directed,2191 we note the language in pro forma
LGIP section 3.6.1 beginning with “Transmission Provider must notify Affected System
Operator of a potential Affected System impact.” If Tri-State is asking to whom the
affected system transmission provider should respond in writing regarding whether it
intends to conduct an affected system study, it should respond to the transmission
provider who notified the affected system operator of a potential affected system impact.
We adopt Pacific Northwest Utilities’ requested clarification and agree with Puget
Sound that, provided that transmission providers properly notify a non-public utility
affected system operator within 10 business days under proposed pro forma LGIP section

3.6.1, such steps are sufficient to demonstrate that the transmission provider has met its
obligations under that section.2192
We agree with Interwest and Invenergy that the interconnection customer should
be permitted to delay posting security and funding for network upgrades under its LGIA
until affected system study results are received in certain situations.2193 Specifically, an
interconnection customer is not required to post security for and fund network upgrades
pursuant to an LGIA if the deadline for LGIA execution, or to request that the LGIA be
filed unexecuted, is delayed under pro forma LGIP section 11.2.1. We agree with
Interwest that this would reduce an affected system interconnection customer’s risk of
incurring affected system network upgrade costs after LGIA execution. However, if the
interconnection customer chooses to proceed to execute an LGIA, or request that the
LGIA be filed unexecuted, it will be responsible for posting security and funding network
upgrades as per the schedule in its LGIA, regardless of whether it has received affected
system study results.
We disagree with commenters that a transmission provider’s obligation to notify a
potential affected system operator of an impact in 10 business days is unrealistic or
problematic.2194 As we are eliminating two trigger events, the host transmission provider

now has the obligation to notify the affected system operator of a potential impact to the
affected system following the completion of the cluster study or restudy, which we find
provides a clear timeline contrary to PacifiCorp’s claims. Furthermore, we do not find
any convincing evidence that a host transmission provider will be unable to provide a
notification to an affected system operator of potential impacts within 10 business days
and note that this timeline is supported by commenters.2195
However, regarding comments that the affected system operator’s obligation to
respond in 15 business days is insufficient,2196 particularly when numerous potential
affected system impacts are identified in a single cluster study, as stated above, we extend
the affected system operator’s response obligation time period from 15 business days to
20 business days to provide the affected system operator with additional time to consider
whether to study these potential affected system impacts on its transmission system,
consistent with Duke Southeast Utilities’ suggestion.2197 We find these timelines
necessary to ensure timely processing of the affected system study process and to provide
certainty to the interconnection customer regarding the processing of the affected system
study.

Affected System Scoping Meeting (Pro
Forma LGIP Section 3.6.2) and Affected
System Study Procedures (Pro Forma LGIP
Section 9.7)

We decline to adopt the proposed requirement in pro forma LGIP section 3.6.2
that affected system transmission providers must hold an affected system scoping
meeting within seven business days after providing written notification that it intends to
conduct an affected system study. We agree with commenters’ concerns that the
difficulties associated with holding an affected system scoping meeting within the
proposed time frame outweigh its potential benefits.2198 We also agree with WAPA that a
meeting after the affected system study is completed would be more beneficial than an
affected system scoping meeting.
We adopt, with modifications, the proposed affected system study procedures set
forth in pro forma LGIP section 9.6, now section 9.7. In particular, we modify the NOPR
proposal to explicitly require clustering of affected system interconnection customers for
study purposes where multiple interconnection requests that are part of a single cluster in
the host system’s cluster study process cause the need for an affected system study. We
find that clustered affected system studies will, consistent with the requirement to use a
first-ready, first-served cluster study process, improve administrative efficiency in the
affected system study process and reduce administrative burden on the affected system

transmission provider, thereby promoting overall efficiency in the interconnection
process. We agree with commenters that serial affected system studies would place an
additional burden on transmission providers to study affected system impacts and would
further slow the interconnection process.2199 We, therefore, believe that mandating
clustering of affected system studies will not place an additional unnecessary burden on
transmission providers, no matter their size; rather, it should reduce such burdens as
compared to multiple serial studies and restudies.
We further modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.7, to require the affected
system transmission provider to complete the affected system study and provide the
affected system interconnection customer with affected system study results within 150
calendar days after receipt of the affected system study agreement, rather than the
proposed 90 calendar days. We agree with commenters that explain that 90 calendar
days may not be adequate time to complete an affected system study,2200 aligning with
our discussion of the potential for affected system transmission providers to conduct a
facilities study under proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.6 below. In recognition of that,
we extend the proposed maximum time frame to complete an affected system study from
the NOPR’s proposed 90 calendar days to 150 calendar days. This extension addresses

Bonneville’s concern that the proposed schedule to complete an affected system study
may have included a due date in excess of the 90-calendar day timeline.
We also modify pro forma LGIP section 9.7, which, as proposed, required the
affected system transmission provider to notify the affected system interconnection
customer that an affected system study will be late, to add a requirement for the affected
system transmission provider to notify the host transmission provider that the affected
system transmission provider will be unable to timely complete the affected system
study.
We adopt Tri-State’s request to add the phrase “and deposit” to pro forma LGIP
section 9.7, such that the affected system transmission provider must provide the affected
system study report to the affected system interconnection customer within 150 calendar
days after the receipt of the affected system study agreement and deposit. We find this
addition is needed to clarify the affected system interconnection customer’s obligation to
provide an affected system study deposit, especially if an affected system interconnection
customer loses its affected system queue position, discussed below, for failure to provide
the required deposit under pro forma LGIP section 9.5. We also add to pro forma LGIP
section 9.7 a requirement for the affected system transmission provider to provide the
affected system study report to the host transmission provider at the same time it provides
the report to the affected system interconnection customer. We find that this will
enhance transparency in the interconnection study process.
In response to MISO’s request for clarification that the affected system study
clock commences only after all necessary data has been provided, we clarify that,

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 740 -

because an affected system interconnection customer has already submitted all required
data to the host transmission provider, and the host transmission provider has verified that
the data submitted is adequate and has conducted at least one interconnection study, it is
highly unlikely that there will be any instances of requiring clarification or further data
from interconnection customers. Thus, under the modified affected system study
procedures, the data regarding interconnection requests given to the affected system
transmission provider should be complete, requiring no delay or requests for further data.
Nevertheless, we note that the affected system interconnection customer is required,
under pro forma LGIP section 9.5, to provide all required technical data when it delivers
the affected system study agreement. As discussed below, the clock for the affected
system transmission provider to complete its affected system study begins after the
receipt of the executed affected system study agreement and study deposit, which would
include the receipt of all required technical data from the affected system interconnection
customer.

Affected System Queue Position (Pro Forma
LGIP Section 9.3)

We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal to add section 9.2, now
section 9.3, titled “Affected System Queue Position,” to the pro forma LGIP.
Specifically, we adopt the first-ready, first-served concept, as proposed in the NOPR,2201

2201

We note that several commenters support the proposed first-ready, first-served
concept under proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.2. See Alliant Energy Initial

along with the affected system relative queue priority proposal. Consequently, the
interconnection requests of affected system interconnection customers that have executed
an affected system study agreement will be higher-queued than the interconnection
requests of those host system interconnection customers that have not yet received their
cluster study results, and lower-queued than those interconnection customers that have
already received their cluster study results. We also add clarifying language to pro forma
LGIP section 9.3 to explain that, although queue position is determined based on the date
of affected system study agreement execution, all affected system interconnection
requests studied within the same affected system cluster will be equally queued.
The affected system interconnection customer’s affected system queue position is
for identification of affected system network upgrades along with the affected system
transmission provider’s own interconnection customers. Specifically, the affected system
queue position determines the order in which the affected system transmission provider
will study the affected system interconnection customers and its own interconnection
customers and thus impacts which network upgrades may be identified as necessary and
assigned to interconnection customers, whether its own or affected system
interconnection customers.
As an example, if a transmission provider has two cluster studies of its own
interconnection customers—cluster study 1 for which the transmission provider is
conducting the facilities studies and cluster study 2 for which the transmission provider is
conducting the cluster study—cluster study 1 would be higher-queued than cluster study
2. If that transmission provider receives notice from a neighboring transmission provider

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 742 -

of interconnection requests that may impact its transmission system (i.e., affected system
interconnection customers), the transmission provider may decide to study those affected
system interconnection customers to determine if any network upgrades are required to
mitigate constraints caused by those affected system interconnection customers. Once
those affected system interconnection customers have executed their affected system
study agreements, the transmission provider must assign them an affected system queue
position, which will be higher than any cluster study of its own interconnection customers
that have not received their cluster study results. In this example, the cluster study 1
interconnection customers would be higher-queued than the cluster of affected system
interconnection customers because the cluster study 1 interconnection customers would
have already received their cluster study results and decided to proceed with their
interconnection requests, and cluster study 2 interconnection customers would be
lower-queued than the cluster of affected system interconnection customers because they
would not have received their cluster study results and thus are more likely to withdraw.
We find that establishing the affected system queue position based on the
execution of the affected system study agreement is appropriate because, at that point, the
affected system interconnection customer has demonstrated its intent to proceed with its
interconnection request by executing the agreement and providing a study deposit to the
affected system transmission provider as well as receiving its cluster study report on its
host system and deciding to proceed with its interconnection request. Furthermore,
allowing these affected system interconnection customers to be higher-queued than any
of its own interconnection customers that have not received their cluster study results is

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 743 -

appropriate because those interconnection customers have not yet received any network
upgrade estimates. Thus, its own interconnection customers have not yet demonstrated
their intention to proceed to the facilities study.
We agree with commenters that establishing queue priority in an affected system
transmission provider’s interconnection queue based on when an interconnection request
is received by the host transmission provider is problematic.2202 In part for this reason,
we are adopting the host system’s cluster study results and execution of the affected
system study agreement as reference points for queue priority2203 because these points
occur after the interconnection customer has made demonstrations to indicate intent to
progress through the interconnection process.
We disagree with NextEra that the NOPR proposal’s affected system queue
priority construct, which we adopt herein, will lead to a race among interconnection
customers to be first or last to sign an affected system study agreement. NextEra’s
concern may occur under a serial affected system study process, but, as explained above,
we require clustering of affected system studies. Studying affected system
interconnection requests in clusters mitigates the risk of a race to execute affected system
study agreements, as affected system interconnection customers in the same affected
system cluster will be equally queued regardless of when they execute their affected
system study agreement, if it is within the appropriate window for affected system study

agreement execution. We find this to be a just and reasonable queue priority construct
for affected system studies.
We decline to adopt EDF Renewables’ suggestion that the affected system
transmission provider be required to establish queue priority between the host and
affected systems based on the interconnection customer having achieved a certain stage
in the host system’s study process, rather than the date the interconnection customer
submits an interconnection request. We clarify that we neither propose to, nor do we
adopt a proposal to, base relative affected system queue priority on the date an
interconnection customer submits its interconnection request.2204
We clarify, in response to Idaho Power’s request, that the affected system study
process adopted in this final rule is required for all transmission providers, regardless of
preexisting use of the first-ready, first-served cluster study process.
We clarify, in response to APPA-LPPC, that establishing the affected system
queue priority is for identifying the affected system network upgrades needed to mitigate
constraints on the affected system.2205 This process will proceed in parallel with the host
transmission provider’s study process and should not result in delays to the
interconnection customer. As discussed above, we allow interconnection customers to

2204

See NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 189 (providing that the affected system
transmission provider would assign the affected system interconnection customer a queue
position in its queue according to when the affected system interconnection customer
executes an affected system study agreement rather than when the affected system
interconnection customer entered its host transmission provider’s queue).

delay execution of their LGIAs, or request that the LGIA be filed unexecuted, if they
have not received their affected system study results; however, based on the reforms we
adopt in this final rule, that should be the exception and not the rule. Thus, we find that
the affected system queue position is merely intended to ensure that affected system
interconnection customers are assigned the appropriate network upgrade costs according
to the Commission’s interconnection pricing policy, and not as an indicator that
interconnection customers become part of two separate interconnection queues.
With respect to requests for clarification regarding proposed pro forma LGIP
section 9.2 and how the first-ready, first-served queue priority approach interacts with
cluster studies,2206 we clarify that all affected system interconnection customers in the
same cluster on the affected system will have equal queue priority in the affected system
transmission provider’s interconnection queue, which is consistent with how the firstready, first-served approach interacts with cluster studies for interconnection customers
on the transmission provider’s transmission system when it is acting as a host system.
This means that the affected system interconnection customers within a cluster have
equal queue priority and that queue priority will be relative to the affected system
transmission provider’s own interconnection customers. The affected system
transmission provider’s own interconnection customers that already received their cluster
study results when an affected system interconnection customer or cluster of affected
system interconnection customers execute an affected system study agreement will be

higher-queued than that affected system interconnection customer. Any of the affected
system transmission provider’s own interconnection customers that receive their cluster
study results after the affected system interconnection customer or cluster of affected
system interconnection customers execute their affected system study agreement will be
lower-queued than that affected system interconnection customer or cluster of affected
system interconnection customers. We clarify in response to APPA-LPPC that a
transmission provider will assign the costs of network upgrades required on its
transmission system to interconnection customers in its host cluster study process and
affected system interconnection customers, also studied in their own cluster, based on
their relative queue priority and in accordance with the proportional impact method as
described in pro forma LGIP section 4.2.3, and as discussed further in the next
section.2207
With respect to Bonneville’s request for clarification, we clarify that an affected
system interconnection customer will lose its affected system queue position if the
affected system interconnection customer fails to: (1) execute the affected system study
agreement or request it be filed unexecuted; (2) execute the affected system facilities
construction agreement or request it be filed unexecuted; (3) provide the affected system
study deposit; or (4) pay undisputed affected system study true-up costs in a timely
manner.

Affected System Cost Allocation (Pro Forma
LGIP Section 9.9)

We also adopt the NOPR proposal in pro forma LGIP section 9.8, now pro forma
LGIP section 9.9, titled “Affected System Cost Allocation,” to allocate affected system
network upgrade costs using a proportional impact method, in accordance with pro forma
LGIP section 4.2.1(1)(b).
We agree with SEIA that using a proportional impact method will reduce
individual affected system network upgrade costs and reduce the likelihood of cascading
withdrawals, consistent with our discussion above on the use of the proportional impact
method for the allocation of network upgrade costs in a cluster on the host system.
We disagree with commenters that argue that the Commission should provide for
penalty-free withdrawal from the host system’s interconnection queue if affected system
study results increase an interconnection customer’s costs by more than 25% or some
other threshold compared to costs allocated by the host transmission provider.2208 First,
we find that the final rule’s requirement that affected system transmission providers use
ERIS modeling standard to conduct affected system studies should reduce the number
and total cost of affected system network upgrades assigned to affected system
interconnection customers, which will reduce instances of “sticker shock” from affected
system network upgrades.2209 Second, as discussed above, any interconnection customers

in a cluster that are not waiting for affected system study results must proceed with the
finalization of their LGIAs, pursuant to pro forma LGIP section 11.1. Thus, we find that
it would create sufficient uncertainty to allow an interconnection customer to withdraw
penalty-free when it receives its affected system study results if there is a 25% increase in
costs, which may occur after other interconnection customers in the same cluster have
finalized their LGIAs. We note that interconnection customers inherently assume some
risk. Accordingly, we decline to explicitly extend penalty-free withdrawal to include
increases in affected system network upgrade costs beyond a certain threshold.
In response to NV Energy’s assertion that use of the proportional impact method
may lead to restudies when a higher-queued affected system interconnection customer
withdraws its interconnection request, we note that potential outcomes of withdrawal are
restudy and the reallocation of costs, regardless of the cost allocation methodology
used.2210 We also note that, as described above, transmission providers may not need to
perform a study if, in their engineering judgment, the network upgrades assigned to the
withdrawing interconnection customer either are not needed or are easily reassigned to a
remaining interconnection customer. Thus, restudies under the new interconnection
process due to interconnection request withdrawals should be relatively less frequent than
under existing processes.

Information Sharing Among Transmission
Providers (Pro Forma LGIP Section 3.6.3)

We decline to adopt proposed section 3.6.3 of the pro forma LGIP, which would
have required a transmission provider to provide data on a monthly basis, or more
frequently as needed, to any affected system operators regarding the amount and location
of proposed generation in the transmission provider’s interconnection queue, as well as
updated information about the transmission provider’s transmission system.2211 We agree
with commenters’ arguments that the information sharing requirement is duplicative of
what is available on OASIS and recognize that such a requirement may be overly
burdensome.2212 The OASIS postings provide transparency regarding the host
transmission provider’s interconnection queue information. Further, transmission
providers are required to notify neighboring transmission providers of potential impacts
on their systems per section 3.6.1 of the pro forma LGIP, as described above.

pro forma LGIP section 9.4, to require that the transmission provider provide the affected
system study agreement within 10 business days of sharing the schedule for the study

with the affected system interconnection customer(s), per pro forma LGIP section 9.2,
rather than within five business days, as proposed. We agree with commenters that five
business days is not enough time to prepare what could be numerous affected system
study agreements in the event a number of interconnection customers in a large cluster on
a neighboring transmission system impact the affected system transmission provider’s
transmission system.
Consistent with our decision—discussed above—to not adopt the proposal to
require affected system transmission providers to convene a scoping meeting with
affected system interconnection customers, we remove references to such a meeting in
pro forma LGIP section 9.4. Accordingly, we modify the NOPR proposal requiring the
affected system operator to provide a non-binding good faith estimate of the cost and
time frame for completing an affected system study from 15 business days after the
affected system scoping meeting to 20 business days from the date that the affected
system operator responded in writing to the host transmission provider that it intends to
conduct an affected system study, pursuant to section 3.6.1 of the pro forma LGIP, and
we also move this requirement to section 9.2 of the pro forma LGIP. The time taken to
tender an affected system study agreement will also be measured from that date. We
believe these changes will align the study timeline to the lack of an affected system
scoping meeting.
Accordingly, we modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.4 so that, after the
affected system transmission provider responds with its intent to conduct an affected
system study, the affected system transmission provider has 10 business days to tender an

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 751 -

affected system study agreement from the date of the affected system transmission
provider sharing the schedule for the study. Again, these changes align the affected
system study process timeline with the modification to remove the affected system
scoping meeting.
We further modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.4 to include a true-up of
the affected system study deposit and actual cost of the affected system study. The
difference between these amounts must be detailed in an invoice and paid by or refunded
to the affected system interconnection customer within 30 calendar days of the receipt of
such invoice. An affected system interconnection customer’s failure to pay the difference
between these amounts will result in loss of that affected system interconnection
customer’s affected system queue position. We find these modifications necessary to
effectuate actual payment of affected system study costs and to outline the consequences
for failure to do so.
With regard to execution of the affected system study agreement, we adopt, with
modification, the NOPR proposal to add section 9.5 to the pro forma LGIP regarding the
timing of the execution of the affected system study agreement. As adopted, pro forma
LGIP section 9.5 states that the affected system interconnection customer has 10 business
days from the date of receipt of the affected system study agreement to execute and
deliver it to the affected system transmission provider. Pro forma LGIP section 9.5 also
provides that, if the affected system interconnection customer does not provide all
required technical data when it delivers the affected system study agreement, the affected
system transmission provider shall notify the affected system interconnection customer of

the deficiency within five business days of the receipt of the affected system study
agreement, and the affected system interconnection customer has 10 business days to
cure the deficiency after receipt of such notice, provided that the deficiency does not
include failure to deliver the executed affected system study agreement or deposit.
In the same vein, we modify proposed section 9.4 of the pro forma LGIP to
require the affected system transmission provider to notify the host transmission provider
of the affected system interconnection customer’s breach of its obligations under this
section, should such breach occur. We find that, absent such notification, the host
transmission provider may be unaware of such a breach.
(h)

Scope of Affected System Study (Pro Forma
LGIP Section 9.6)

We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal in pro forma LGIP section 9.5,
now pro forma LGIP section 9.6, regarding the scope of the affected system study. The
affected system study will consider the base case as well as all higher-queued generating
facilities on the affected system transmission provider’s transmission system and will
consist of a power flow, stability, and short circuit analysis. The affected system study
will provide a list of affected system network upgrades that are required because of the
affected system interconnection customer’s proposed interconnection, a non-binding
good faith estimate of cost responsibility, and a non-binding good faith estimated time to
construct. We find that these requirements will ensure that the affected system study will
identify affected system network upgrades that are necessary to mitigate the impacts of
the affected system interconnection customer’s proposed generating facility on the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

affected system while providing the affected system interconnection customer with
estimated costs and a timeline to construct necessary network upgrades.
In response to APPA-LPPC, Duke Southeast Utilities, Enel, and Pattern Energy,
we modify the NOPR proposal and clarify that pro forma LGIP section 9.6 does not
preclude affected system transmission providers from conducting facilities studies or
other relevant studies when conducting affected system studies. The affected system
study may consist of a system impact study, a facilities study, or a combination of a
system impact and facilities study.
To address commenters’ criticism that the NOPR proposal was ambiguous with
respect to whether a facilities study is specifically contemplated as part of the affected
system study process,2213 we clarify that it is. We agree with commenters that an affected
system facilities study could provide more refined cost estimates and construction
timelines to better apprise the affected system interconnection customer of expected
affected system network upgrade costs and timing, thereby improving interconnection
process efficiency.2214 We note that the study requirements for the affected system study
under pro forma LGIP section 9.6 that we proposed in the NOPR, and adopt in this final
rule, require the affected system transmission provider to produce the same information
that a facilities study would produce; specifically, the affected system transmission

provider must provide a list of facilities that are required as a result of an affected system
interconnection customer’s proposed interconnection, a non-binding good faith estimate
of cost responsibility, and a non-binding good faith estimated time to construct.
Nevertheless, for further clarity, we modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 9.6 to
indicate that the affected system study may consist of a system impact study, a facilities
study, or some combination thereof. We note that we have modified the proposal to
provide more time to the transmission provider to conduct such studies that they deem
necessary, as discussed above.
In response to Duke Southeast Utilities’ request for clarification that affected
system transmission providers conduct a series of two affected system studies, we
reiterate that nothing precludes an affected system transmission provider from conducting
an affected system facilities study following an affected system impact study, just as
nothing precludes affected system transmission providers from conducting a combined
version of such studies, and we believe we have provided adequate time for transmission
providers to do so.
We find out of scope Shell’s request for inclusion of further information on local
transmission planning from neighboring public utility transmission providers in the
affected system study results.

Meeting with Transmission Provider (Pro
Forma LGIP Section 9.8) and Affected
System Facilities Construction Agreement
(Pro Forma LGIP Section 9.10)

We adopt proposed section 9.9, now section 9.10, of the pro forma LGIP, with
modifications. Specifically, we adopt the requirement for an affected system
transmission provider to tender to the affected system interconnection customer an
affected system facilities construction agreement within 30 calendar days of providing
the affected system study report. We modify this section to require the affected system
transmission provider to provide 10 business days—rather than five business days, as
proposed—after receipt of the affected system facilities construction agreement for the
affected system interconnection customer to execute the agreement or have the affected
system transmission provider file it unexecuted with the Commission. While no
comments were filed in opposition to the five business days to notify the affected system
transmission provider of the affected system interconnection customer’s intent to execute
the agreement or request it to be filed unexecuted, as proposed in the NOPR, we believe
that 10 business days gives the affected system interconnection customer a more
appropriate length of time to review the facilities construction agreement and the
timelines and costs contained therein to make a reasoned decision as to whether to

Further, we find that it is appropriate to allow the interconnection customer to
request that the affected system facilities construction agreement be filed unexecuted at
the Commission. Similar to an interconnection customer’s ability pursuant to pro forma

LGIP section 11.3 to request the unexecuted filing of its LGIA, the ability to request the
affected system facilities construction agreement be filed unexecuted allows an affected
system interconnection customer to dispute provisions of the affected system facilities
construction agreement before the Commission.2215 Because (1) the existing pro forma
LGIP section 11.3 permits the interconnection customer to request the transmission
provider to file the LGIA unexecuted, (2) we base the affected system facilities
construction agreement on the pro forma LGIA, and (3) the affected system facilities
construction agreement is like a service agreement,2216 it is appropriate to include a
similar provision. We further find that an affected system interconnection customer may
be in a disadvantageous position to negotiate the terms of an affected system facilities
construction agreement, as this agreement is between the affected system interconnection
customer and a transmission provider with which it does not directly connect.
Accordingly, to encourage good faith and fair dealings between the parties and to avoid

the addition of potentially discriminatory terms or conditions to an affected system
facilities construction agreement, we allow an affected system interconnection customer
to request that an affected system facilities construction agreement be filed unexecuted
before the Commission.
We disagree with commenters’ assertions that 30 calendar days may be an
inadequate length of time to tender an affected system facilities construction agreement
or that considerable time is needed to draft such an agreement.2217 This is the same
period of time by which the transmission provider must tender a draft LGIA to the
interconnection customer, the timeline of which is set forth in the existing pro forma
LGIP.2218 We believe these timelines should be consistent because these agreements
include similar provisions and similar requirements and the record does not persuade us
otherwise.
We disagree with Idaho Power’s suggestion that the affected system transmission
provider should tender an affected system facilities construction agreement within
60 calendar days of the interconnection customer executing a facilities study agreement
with the host transmission provider because, as the host system and affected system study
processes are separate, though overlapping and interrelated, it is more administratively
feasible to tie affected system study process deadlines to affected system study process

events. In response to Idaho Power’s suggestion that the affected system transmission
provider should tender an affected system facilities construction agreement within 30
calendar days of providing the affected system study results to the affected system
interconnection customer if the affected system study is performed during the facilities
study on the host transmission provider’s system,2219 we note that, as proposed in the
NOPR, the affected system facilities construction agreement tender deadline is within
30 calendar days of the tendering of the affected system study report without any
additional caveats or conditions. This tender timeline is, however, not directly linked to
the host transmission provider’s study process.
We also adopt the NOPR proposal to add section 9.7, now section 9.8, to the
pro forma LGIP. Section 9.8 of the pro forma LGIP, titled “Meeting with Transmission
Provider,” requires the affected system transmission provider and the affected system
interconnection customer to meet within 10 business days of the affected system
transmission provider tendering the affected system study report to the affected system
interconnection customer. We find that such a meeting between the affected system
transmission provider and affected system interconnection customer will facilitate
transparency and meaningful communication in the affected system study process. We
note that WAPA stated that a meeting after the affected system study report is tendered
would be more beneficial than an affected system scoping meeting. We agree with
WAPA and find that no changes to this section are necessary.

Restudy Period (Pro Forma LGIP Section
9.11)

We adopt the NOPR proposal in section 9.10, now section 9.11, of the pro forma
LGIP to include a maximum 60-calendar day restudy period for any affected system
restudies. We find that 60 calendar days are adequate to complete an affected system
restudy. We disagree that affected system restudies are as complex as host system
restudies, as affected system studies will likely involve fewer interconnection requests
than cluster studies on the host system. Additionally, as discussed further below, we find
that standardization of affected system study assumptions through ERIS modeling criteria
will further simplify both affected system studies and restudies. Thus, we find it just and
reasonable to adopt a 60-calendar day affected system restudy period.
In addition to the 60-calendar day restudy period, we adopt a 30-calendar day
notification requirement for the affected system transmission provider to notify the
affected system interconnection customer of the need for affected system restudy upon
discovery of such need in pro forma LGIP section 9.11. We find such a notification
requirement to be consistent with restudy notification on the host system, and we find
such notification necessary to continue a timely affected system study process.
Accordingly, we find such a notification period to be just and reasonable.

Coordination Between Host Transmission
Provider and Affected System Transmission
Provider

In response to multiple commenters’ assertions that, for efficiency reasons, host
transmission providers should be required to coordinate affected system study activities

with affected system transmission providers rather than individual interconnection
customers,2220 or that flexibility should be afforded in terms of the parties to the affected
system study agreement and the affected system facilities construction agreement,2221 the
Commission is not persuaded that any potential efficiencies of such coordination
outweigh the burdens that may be placed on host transmission providers, and we decline
to require it in this final rule. We note that, in many cases, the affected system operator
may be a non-public utility transmission provider, which would limit the usefulness of
such a requirement. However, we encourage any such voluntary coordination between
transmission providers who share transmission system seams and whose interconnection
customers frequently impact each other’s systems. We also note that, as NextEra
suggests, such transmission providers may file seams agreements under FPA section
205.2222
In response to Indicated PJM TOs’ argument that affected system studies should
be integrated into the cluster study process, we do not have a record to support such a
requirement in the final rule. Integrating affected system interconnection customers into
a cluster that is already proceeding through the study process could meaningfully change
network upgrade cost estimates which could, in turn, create new interconnection request
withdrawals, leading to restudies and delays. Maintaining the clusters as-is and placing

interconnection customers that have received cost estimates will ensure this situation
does not happen.
In response to APS’ request for clarification on how the proposed affected system
study process correlates to the host system’s studies and aligns with the host system’s
requirements,2223 we explain that the affected system study is predicated on the
completion of a cluster study in the host transmission provider’s interconnection queue.
Relative queue position for the affected system study is also determined based on an
interconnection customer’s completion of the host system cluster study. While the host
transmission provider will likely complete its facilities study prior to an affected system
transmission provider’s completion of an affected system study, we add a requirement for
host transmission providers with interconnection customers that have not yet received
their affected system study results to delay the LGIA execution (or unexecuted filing)
deadline for those interconnection customers. An interconnection customer’s failure to
satisfy its obligations under the pro forma LGIP, including coordination with the affected
system transmission provider, where applicable, will result in the loss of the
interconnection customer’s affected system queue position.

Non-Public Utility Requests

We reject requests to impose firm deadlines and requirements that prevent nonpublic utility transmission providers from interfering with jurisdictional interconnection
agreements because we do not have the jurisdiction to do so.2224
In response to concerns regarding a transmission provider’s liability for delays or
inaction by non-public utility transmission providers,2225 we clarify that transmission
providers will not face consequences for the inaction of a non-public utility transmission
provider, as long as the transmission providers fulfill their obligations as outlined in their
LGIPs. For example, under the pro forma LGIP affected system process, a transmission
provider would satisfy its obligation to a non-public utility affected system operator by
timely notifying it of an affected system impact per pro forma LGIP section 3.6.1.

thus intra-RTO/ISO considerations do not apply in this context and are beyond the scope

We disagree with Invenergy’s argument that affected system study process
reforms should apply to all pending interconnection requests and active studies.2227
While we adopt a transition approach for serial and cluster study processes in the final
rule, as explained above, we did not propose a similar transition approach with respect to
affected system studies in the NOPR. Without consistency between transition processes
as they pertain to neighboring transmission providers and implicate the affected system
study process, it would be practically infeasible to apply the affected system study
process reforms to all pending interconnection requests and active studies as Invenergy
suggests. Accordingly, we decline to apply the affected system study process reforms
adopted in this final rule to any pending interconnection requests and active studies.

Need for Reform
(a)

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission expressed concern that the lack of pro forma
agreements for affected system studies and the construction of network upgrades on
affected systems was hindering the efficiency of the generator interconnection process
through increased litigation over such agreements and allowed for potential unduly
discriminatory behavior against interconnection customers whose interconnection
requests necessitate affected system network upgrades.2231 Noting a recent increase in
affected system-related disputes, the Commission preliminarily found it unjust and
unreasonable to leave affected system agreements wholly up to individual negotiations
and proposed standardized pro forma affected system agreements that minimize the
likelihood for such disputes by (1) stipulating how to study the impact of interconnecting
generating facilities on an affected system to identify network upgrades needed to
accommodate the interconnection request and (2) standardizing the affected system
facilities construction agreement to set the terms and conditions for the construction of
those network upgrades.2232

Pro Forma Affected System Study Agreement
(a)

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to establish a pro forma affected system
study agreement to improve the efficiency and transparency of the interconnection
customer’s interaction with the affected system transmission provider.2240 The
Commission proposed to model the pro forma affected system study agreement on the
form of the existing pro forma system impact study agreement, with necessary minor
revisions to the party names.2241 Specifically, the affected system interconnection
customer and affected system transmission provider would be parties to the agreement.
In articles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, of the proposed pro forma affected system
study agreement, the agreement specifies (1) the capitalization of defined terms in the pro
forma LGIP, (2) that coordination with the host transmission provider shall occur
pursuant to pro forma LGIP section 9, (3) that study assumptions shall be set forth in
attachment A to the agreement, and (4) that studies shall be based on technical
information provided by the affected system interconnection customer. In article 5, with
regard to the information the affected system transmission provider will provide to the
affected system interconnection customer in a study report upon completion of the
affected system study, the Commission proposed to require the following: identification
of any circuit breaker short circuit capability limits exceeded as a result of the

interconnection; identification of any thermal overload or voltage limit violations
resulting from the interconnection; identification of any instability or inadequately
damped response to system disturbances resulting from the interconnection; a nonbinding, good faith estimate of the cost of facilities on the affected system required to
accommodate the interconnection of the affected system interconnection customer’s
project to the host transmission system; and a description of how such facilities will
address the identified short circuit, instability, and power flow issues identified in the
affected system study.2242 The Commission sought comment on whether the information
required for the study report would provide adequate information to the affected system
interconnection customer to understand the results of the affected system study. Finally,
in articles 6 and 7, the Commission specified the provision of an affected system study
deposit and that standard miscellaneous terms would be used consistent with industry
best practice and with the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA.

Comments

Some commenters generally support the NOPR proposal to develop a pro forma

proposed in the NOPR. For example, MISO states that the requirement to execute an

agreement with each affected system interconnection customer would create a significant
amount of work for transmission providers that is likely to divert resources from
performing studies and coordinating with other transmission providers without any
greater benefit than provided by existing joint operating agreements and other seams
agreements with neighboring systems.2244 SPP adds that requiring individualized
invoicing for all affected system study requests from another transmission provider’s
cluster study would present a significant administrative burden for both transmission
providers and interconnection customers, which would be required to deal with multiple
transmission providers, instead of just the host transmission provider.2245 SPP notes that,
in its joint operating agreement with MISO, the transmission providers coordinate
affected system studies following each transmission provider’s system impact studies on
their own systems, and rather than invoicing each interconnection customer individually,
the transmission providers invoice each other for study costs, which allows the host
transmission provider to use existing study deposits when available, and otherwise collect
from its interconnection customers as needed.2246
Other commenters suggest specific changes to the language proposed in the
NOPR. For instance, Tri-State proposes adding language to article 9.4 of the pro forma
LGIP specifying a protocol if deficiencies are not cured, such as, “shall be deemed

withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.7 of this LGIP.”2247 PPL argues that the pro forma
affected system study agreement should: (1) have article 7 replaced entirely with actual
contractual terms; (2) contain a clear requirement for affected system interconnection
customers to provide data in a timely manner; (3) include data ownership and
confidentiality provisions; and (4) address restudies.2248
Additionally, Tri-State includes an appendix containing a redline version of the
pro forma affected system study agreement that specifies its requested revisions to the
agreement. Of note, Tri-State proposes changes to article 6, which would require the
affected system transmission provider to specify the affected system study deposit
value.2249
In response to whether the information required in the affected system study report
would provide adequate information to the affected system interconnection customer to
understand the results of the affected system study, Xcel states that the proposed
information is adequate.2250 Duke Southeast Utilities support the information required by
article 5 of the proposed agreement but suggest that any other identified impacts outside
of the prescribed information should also be included.2251 LADWP believes that the

other special protection systems may be required.2252

agreement to make the language therein consistent with similar language elsewhere in the
pro forma LGIP.2257
Starting with the multiparty pro forma affected system study agreement, as
described above, we require affected system transmission providers to study affected
system interconnection requests in clusters. To facilitate this change, we modify the
NOPR proposal and establish a pro forma multiparty affected system study agreement
that closely tracks the proposed two-party agreement. Such a pro forma multiparty
agreement will allow affected system transmission providers to enter into the same
affected system study agreement with each of the affected system interconnection
customers that it must study in a cluster. We find that a pro forma multiparty affected
system study agreement will facilitate interactions with the affected system transmission
provider, making them more efficient and transparent. We agree with SPP and MISO
that a requirement for an affected system transmission provider to sign affected system
study agreements with each affected system interconnection customer would be
burdensome.2258 In creating a pro forma multiparty affected system study agreement, we
reduce the administrative burden on transmission providers that no longer need to
manage several individual affected system study agreements.

In response to SPP and MISO’s suggestion to make the parties to the pro forma
affected system study agreement the affected system transmission provider and the host
transmission provider, we decline this request. We believe that the interconnection
customer, as the one responsible for providing necessary information about the proposed
generating facility as well as funding the affected system study, is the appropriate
counterparty to the affected system study agreement. We note, however, that any
transmission providers may propose alternative arrangements through joint operating
agreements or otherwise pursuant to FPA section 205.
In response to comments from Tri-State and PPL’s request regarding affected
system interconnection customers that fail to provide required information,2259 we find
that sufficient requirements for data sharing exist in both the current and newly adopted
pro forma LGIP requirements. Specifically, as discussed above and consistent with
comments from Tri-State, we modify pro forma LGIP section 9.5 to explicitly state that
any affected system interconnection customer failing to submit required information and
failing to cure that deficiency shall lose its affected system queue position. We also add
to pro forma LGIP section 9.5 a requirement that the affected system transmission
provider notify the host transmission provider in a timely manner of such failure by the
affected system interconnection customer.
In response to Tri-State’s requested revisions to article 6 of the pro forma affected
system study agreement, we modify the pro forma affected system study agreement to

add additional language to explicitly require affected system interconnection customers to
provide a study deposit. The deposit will provide for the cost of the affected system
interconnection study. Moreover, we find that such revisions will align the pro forma
affected system study agreement with Appendix 2 (cluster study agreement), Appendix 3
(interconnection facilities study agreement), and Appendix 4 (optional interconnection
study agreement) of the pro forma LGIP.
In response to PPL’s request that article 7, regarding standard miscellaneous
terms, should be replaced with actual contractual terms, we decline to adopt PPL’s
proposed revisions. We adopt article 7 of the pro forma affected system study
agreement, with modification to eliminate the reference to the LGIA. We note that this
article 7 is consistent with the existing pro forma interconnection system impact study
agreement (which the Commission is replacing with new cluster study-based agreements
adopted in this final rule), interconnection facilities study agreement, and optional
interconnection study agreement, which also provide for standard miscellaneous terms.
In response to PPL’s requests that the pro forma affected system study agreement should
address data ownership and confidentiality requirements as well as restudies, we find
such revisions to the proposed pro forma affected system study agreement unnecessary,
as they would be duplicative of existing pro forma LGIP provisions regarding
confidentiality (section 13.1) and restudies (former section 6.4, now contained in sections
7.5, 8.5, and 9.10). Regarding the removal of the reference to the LGIA, we find that the
removal is appropriate as the parties to an interconnection customer’s LGIA would not be
the same parties to an affected system study agreement.

In response to comments on the scope of the pro forma affected system study, we
agree with Xcel that the scope of the affected system study is adequate.2260
Consequently, we decline to modify the scope of the affected system study contained in
article 5 of the proposed pro forma affected system study agreement. We note that the
scope of the affected system studies identified in article 5 is consistent with the scope of
host system interconnection studies.2261 In response to comments from Duke Southeast
Utilities that entities should be able to include other, identified impacts in the affected
system study report, we clarify that the scope of affected system studies must be
consistent with the scope listed in article 5 of the pro forma affected system study
agreement. Affording affected system transmission providers flexibility to expand the
scope of affected system studies on an ad hoc or individual basis creates the potential for
undue discrimination and a barrier to entry. With respect to LADWP’s request to include
impacts to remedial action schemes and other special protection systems within the scope
of the affected system studies,2262 we clarify that such impacts are already contemplated
in article 5 of the pro forma affected system study agreement.

Pro Forma Affected System Facilities Construction
Agreement
(a)

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to add a pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement.2263 The proposed pro forma
affected system facilities construction agreement includes provisions on the following:
terms of the agreement; construction of network upgrades; taxes; force majeure;
information reporting; security, billing, and payments; assignment; indemnity; breach,
cure, and default; termination; contractors; confidentiality; information access and audit
rights; dispute resolution; and notices.2264 Proposed Appendix A to the agreement
provides for details on identified network upgrades, cost estimates and responsibility, the
construction schedule for network upgrades, and a payment schedule; proposed Appendix
B addresses notification of completed construction; and proposed Appendix C provides
for a transmission provider site map, a site plan, a plan and profile for network upgrades,
and the estimated cost of the network upgrades.
The Commission proposed that the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement would be entered into by the affected system transmission
provider and the affected system interconnection customer.2265 Under the NOPR

proposal, the affected system transmission provider would be responsible for the design,
procurement, construction, and installation of all network upgrades identified in
Appendix A using reasonable efforts to complete construction consistent with the
schedule identified in Appendix A. The affected system interconnection customer would
initially fund the cost of any assigned network upgrades and be reimbursed by the
affected system transmission provider.2266 Rather, the Commission proposed to require
that, consistent with Order No. 2003, the affected system interconnection customer must
enter into an agreement with the affected system transmission provider that must specify
the terms governing payments to be made by the affected system interconnection
customer as well as payment of refunds by the affected system transmission provider for
the full cost of network upgrades, plus interest.2267
The Commission clarified that the term to be mutually agreed upon for payment of
refunds to affected system interconnection customer funded network upgrades is not to
exceed 20 years.2268 This term mirrors the repayment term in the pro forma LGIA but
allows for flexibility for the parties to come to another arrangement if they prefer. Under
the NOPR proposal, within six months of completion of construction of any required
network upgrades, the affected system transmission provider would invoice the affected

system interconnection customer for the final construction costs, including a true-up of
estimated and actual costs. The pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement would terminate upon the affected system transmission provider’s final
repayment to the affected system interconnection customer. Alternatively, the affected
system interconnection customer could also terminate the affected system facilities
construction agreement with 60 calendar days’ written notice to the affected system
transmission provider.
The Commission sought comment on the network upgrade funding and repayment
provisions in the proposed pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement,
specifically whether the repayment time frame and the similarity of the proposal to the
repayment terms in the pro forma LGIA were appropriate.2269 The Commission also
sought comment on whether any articles or provisions should be added to the proposed
pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement or whether the proposed
provisions were sufficient.2270

Some commenters request that the Commission allow for regional variations to

Comments on Specific Provisions and
Related Proposals

As a global change, Xcel recommends that the defined term “affected system
operator” be used instead of “transmission provider” when referencing the affected
system transmission provider, arguing that the use of the terms “transmission provider”
and “transmission provider acting as affected system” are confusing and may conflict
with usage of those terms in the LGIP.2274
With regard to article 2 (Term of Agreement), Tri-State proposes the following
addition: “No Transmission Delivery Service. The execution of this LGIA does not
constitute a request for, nor the provision of, any transmission delivery service under
Transmission Provider’s Tariff, and does not convey any right to deliver electricity to any
specific customer or Point of Delivery.”2275 Additionally, Tri-State opposes the option in

proposed article 2.2.1 that would allow the affected system interconnection customer to
terminate the affected system facilities construction agreement with 60 calendar days’
written notice. Tri-State contends that allowing such termination could trigger restudies
for the affected system transmission provider.2276
Southern states that the Commission should either reconsider or clarify proposed
article 2.2.2 (Termination Upon Default) and proposed article 5.2 (Notice of Breach,
Cure, and Default), which it states appears to provide that if a default does not pose a
threat to the reliability of the affected system transmission provider’s transmission
system, the affected system transmission provider may not terminate the agreement if the
affected system interconnection customer has begun to cure and compensate the
transmission provider for any damage.2277 Southern argues that such provisions should
be consistent with pro forma LGIA provisions and that, if an affected system
interconnection customer defaults under the LGIA, the affected system operator should
not be required to build affected system network upgrades. Southern argues that, if the
provisions are not consistent with the pro forma LGIA, affected system transmission
providers will build affected system network upgrades that are not needed, and there will
be different default and termination rights applicable to these improvements. Similarly,
Tri-State submits suggested edits to proposed article 2.2.2, which remove the provisions

Southern comments on, explaining that a default should only occur after a breach and
failure to cure.2278
Invenergy opposes proposed article 2.2.3, which provides that, upon termination
of the affected system facilities construction agreement, the affected system
interconnection customer would be responsible for costs incurred by another affected
system interconnection customer due to the termination of: (1) its affected system
facilities construction agreement; (2) that interconnection customer’s LGIA; or (3) any of
that interconnection customer’s other affected system facilities construction
agreements.2279 Some commenters argue that this requirement is unreasonable and must
be revised.2280 They claim that there is no basis for imposing on the affected system
interconnection customer broad and potentially exorbitant liability for any potential
impacts on any other interconnection customer within the affected system, which they
argue exceeds potential liability imposed under the pro forma LGIA for the host
transmission provider’s transmission system.2281 Invenergy states that the provision
appears to be based on a provision in MISO’s pro forma facilities construction

agreement.
As for proposed article 3 (Construction of Network Upgrades), some commenters
object to limiting the right to suspend for force majeure events, contained in proposed
article 3.1.2.1.2282 Southern states that proposed article 3.1.2.1 appears to provide that the
affected system interconnection customer may only suspend its interconnection request if
there is a force majeure event and that no such limitation on suspension rights exists
under the pro forma LGIA, meaning that an affected system interconnection customer
could suspend its interconnection request under the pro forma LGIA but still be required
to move forward with construction of affected system network upgrades, if the reason for
suspension under the pro forma LGIA is not a force majeure event.2283 Enel asserts that
the Commission has not provided justification for limiting the affected system
interconnection customer’s suspension rights to just force majeure events.2284 Enel,
Invenergy, and Southern argue that suspension rights under the pro forma affected
system facilities construction agreement should be consistent with the suspension rights
under the pro forma LGIA, with Invenergy highlighting that the pro forma LGIA permits
suspension for up to three years.2285 Conversely, Tri-State argues that the same force

majeure language used in proposed article 3.1.2.1 should be added to both the pro forma
LGIA and pro forma LGIP.2286
MISO suggests that there should be a provision in the pro forma affected system
facilities construction agreement on cross-defaults between the affected system facilities
construction agreement and the interconnection customer’s LGIA.2287 MISO asserts that,
as proposed, if the affected system interconnection customer refuses to make payments
under an affected system facilities construction agreement, it is unclear how it would
affect the affected system interconnection customer’s LGIA.
In response to proposed article 3.2.2.1, which would require affected system
transmission providers to reimburse affected system interconnection customers for their
affected system network upgrade costs, many commenters support the proposal,2288 while
many others oppose it.2289 In support, commenters contend that the reimbursement policy
is consistent with long-established Commission precedent and cost causation, as it

ensures that affected system network upgrade cost reimbursement is rate-based, such that
the transmission customers that ultimately benefit from the network upgrades pay for
those upgrades.2290 In contrast, according to these commenters, allowing transmission
customers of the affected system to receive the benefits of an affected system network
upgrade, without paying for it, would create a “free-rider” problem that is inconsistent
with the “beneficiary pays” principle.2291
Other commenters do not fully oppose the proposal but suggest changes to
proposed article 3.2.2.1. For instance, MISO and Southern contend that the repayment
provisions for affected system interconnection customers should be consistent with how
the transmission provider repays its internal interconnection customers.2292 MISO asserts
that this will ensure comparability and non-discriminatory treatment between affected
system interconnection customers and “native” interconnection customers interconnected
to the affected system.2293 APPA-LPPC argue that the NOPR proposal is missing an
express, contractual commitment ensuring that an interconnection customer will fund
network upgrades identified by the affected system as a condition of interconnection.2294
APPA-LPPC state that they believe this to be implicit in the proposal and that the

provision should specify that the identified affected system transmission provider is an
intended third-party beneficiary of the LGIA. APPA-LPPC contend that the absence of
such a contractual obligation on the part of the interconnection customer is a particular
concern for non-public utilities, which have no standing under the FPA to seek funding
for network upgrades under Commission-jurisdictional tariffs. However, according to
Southern, in Order No. 2003, the Commission declined to make a generic finding on the
possibility of network upgrade costs being passed onto native load and transmission
customers and instead allowed transmission providers to make a filing if such entities
were not being held harmless.2295 Southern states that the Commission should clarify that
a transmission provider can make such a filing, if warranted, in which it could propose
that affected system interconnection customers bear the cost responsibility of identified
affected system network upgrades.2296
Among issues raised by commenters that oppose the proposal, one common
concern is that the proposal would force affected system transmission providers to
subsidize interconnection to neighboring transmission systems, despite potentially not
receiving any energy from such interconnection customers, causing increased costs to the
affected system due to the requirement to mitigate negative thermal, voltage, and stability

impacts without a corresponding increase in benefits.2297 North Carolina Commission
and Staff also contend that the Commission has not provided evidence on this matter that
would allow the Commission to meet its burden under FPA section 206.2298 Some
commenters assert that the affected system interconnection customer should be
responsible for the costs of affected system network upgrades in exchange for use of the
affected system (i.e., via transmission service).2299 Xcel notes that, for loop flow impacts,
the affected system interconnection customer may not formally take transmission service
but may be granted the right to the transmission capacity associated with the loop flows
they cause, and some transmission providers have charged unreserved use for such
impacts or otherwise required neighbors to pay for the transmission use.2300
North Carolina Commission and Staff observe that, if the Commission were to
implement the NOPR proposal and allow RTOs/ISOs to obtain independent entity
variations from the proposed affected system pricing scheme implementing a participant
funding model, then North Carolina retail and wholesale customers of Duke Energy
Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress would be paying for affected system network

transmission system in addition to paying for network upgrade costs for native
interconnection customers when generating facilities interconnect with Duke Energy
Progress or Duke Energy Carolinas-owned transmission facilities, which they argue
would be patently unjust, unfair, and unduly preferential.2301
Several commenters argue that the NOPR proposal is contrary to important
objectives articulated in Order No. 2003.2302 For instance, Duke Southeast Utilities
contend that, if transmission providers are required to reimburse affected system
interconnection customers for costs advanced for affected system network upgrades, such
transmission providers will seek to obtain rate recovery of their reimbursement cost from
existing wholesale and retail transmission customers, meaning those classes of customers
will not be protected from adverse rate implications because they will have to absorb all
affected system network upgrade costs.2303 According to Duke Southeast Utilities, this is
contrary to an important objective articulated in Order No. 2003-B of the interconnection
pricing policy protecting existing transmission customers from adverse rate implications

associated with interconnection facilities and network upgrades required to interconnect a
new generating facility.2304
According to PPL, the pricing policy established in Order No. 2003 was meant to
promote competition in markets “still dominated by non-independent transmission
providers.”2305 PPL argues that non-RTO/ISO transmission providers no longer
dominate, and therefore this policy is no longer necessary.2306 PPL asserts that, contrary
to the time of Order No. 2003’s issuance, and as a result of the size and nature of
generating facilities being developed in RTO/ISO regions, non-RTOs/ISOs might be
required to build costly affected system network upgrades to accommodate the
interconnection of generating facilities in adjacent markets. PPL contends that affected
system network upgrade costs can overwhelm the total network upgrade costs identified
for reliability or other planning purposes. PPL claims, however, that the affected system
network upgrade reimbursement proposal in the NOPR is directly contrary to the
Commission’s interconnection pricing policy meant to protect existing customers from
the rate impacts of interconnection-related network upgrades,2307 and allows affected
system interconnection customers to benefit from network upgrades without paying for

them.2308 Thus, PPL asserts that the Commission should allow affected system
transmission providers the flexibility to directly assign affected system network upgrade
costs. Duke Southeast Utilities concur, asserting that there is ample precedent of the
Commission accepting, without modification, an affected system operating agreement
between affected system transmission providers and affected system interconnection
customers that directly assign network upgrade costs to such interconnection customers
without reimbursement.2309
Invenergy asserts that the Commission should reject arguments challenging the
Commission’s interconnection pricing policy established in Order No. 2003.2310
Invenergy contends that this interconnection pricing policy was fully litigated in the
Order No. 2003 rulemaking proceeding and that issues relating to cost causation were
fully and carefully considered at that time.2311 Invenergy also argues that Duke Southeast
Utilities’ reference to Order No. 2003-B is misplaced, as the Commission, in Order No.

customers and that transmission providers could make and justify alternative proposals
on compliance.2312
Duke Southeast Utilities and North Carolina Commission and Staff assert that the
affected system network upgrade reimbursement proposal will stifle renewable
generating facility development.2313 For instance, Duke Southeast Utilities argue that
mandatory reimbursement has the likelihood of chilling development of new, mainly
renewable, generating facilities in states that consider such costs as part of overall
development costs when considering whether to issue a certificate of public convenience
and necessity to permit these generating facilities.2314
Moreover, Duke Southeast Utilities argue that the mandatory reimbursement by
affected system transmission providers of affected system network upgrade costs fails to
encourage efficient siting decisions by affected system interconnection customers.2315
Duke Southeast Utilities assert that, if affected system interconnection customers are
reimbursed for 100% of the costs of network upgrades on the affected system plus

interest at the Commission-prescribed rate, they actually profit financially from such
reimbursement.2316
Invenergy argues that the possibility of certain states considering affected system
network upgrade costs in permitting proceedings does not call the Commission’s existing
pricing policy into question.2317 In response to arguments that the NOPR proposal could
foster inefficient siting, Invenergy asserts that this argument was considered and settled
in the Order No. 2003 rulemaking proceeding.2318 Invenergy contends that such
comments are speculative and ignore other facts, such as that identification of affected
system network upgrades typically occurs after most siting decisions are made.
North Carolina Commission and Staff argue that affected system costs are no
longer incidental or rare and have been escalating over time.2319 North Carolina
Commission and Staff allege that the proposed crediting policy will force North Carolina
wholesale and retail ratepayers to subsidize the policy choices of other states and the
corporate goals of businesses located in other states.

unrelated to state and corporate policies.2320 Public Interest Organizations assert that the
proposal is meant to address existing gaps in the pro forma LGIP that apply to all
interconnection customers regardless of fuel type and motivation for generating facility
development.
WAPA expresses significant concerns with the NOPR proposal, emphasizing that
it requires the affected system transmission provider to reimburse the affected system
interconnection customer cash plus interest over 20 years for the cost of affected system
network upgrades.2321 WAPA states that, as a federal agency, it cannot provide a cash
payment with interest to an interconnection customer that does not take transmission
service from WAPA.2322 According to WAPA, per its tariff, it only provides network
credits, not cash payments, for such customers, and it would need to work with the host
transmission provider to ensure a mechanism is developed to properly credit the affected
system interconnection customer.2323

Also on proposed article 3 of the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement, Tri-State notes that proposed article 3.2.2.1 (Repayment) does not contain a
reference to determine if affected system network upgrades are unnecessary.2324
Separately, Tri-State also suggests revisions to state that the repayment period should end
no later than 20 years from the completion of the construction of the affected system
interconnection customer’s generating facility, rather than completion of the construction
of the affected system network upgrades.2325
With regard to proposed article 4 (Security, Billing, and Payments), PacifiCorp
offers suggested revisions to proposed article 4.1, which PacifiCorp asserts are intended
to, among other things, clarify that additional security will be required from the affected
system interconnection customer if the affected system transmission provider determines
that the costs of facilities may exceed the initial estimate provided to the affected system
interconnection customer.2326 PPL also states that affected system interconnection
customers should be required to meet credit and security requirements.2327

Commenters also respond to the proposed confidentiality provisions. Southern
asserts that proposed article 8.1 in the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement, section 13.1 in the pro forma LGIP, and article 22 in the pro forma LGIA
should be revised to reflect the use of backup servers and the obligations of transmission
providers to share information under NERC Reliability Standards.2329 Southern asserts
that it is administratively difficult to meet the requirements in these provisions that
specify that confidential information be destroyed or returned, arguing that this provision
should allow information to be stored on backup servers. Southern also notes that, under
NERC Reliability Standards, which were developed after the effective date of Order No.
2003, transmission providers must disclose confidential information to neighboring
transmission providers, and therefore, this language should be updated to reflect that the
transmission provider must share this confidential information.

the affected system interconnection customer(s) will enter into the agreement; and the
agreement will set forth the terms and conditions by which the affected system
transmission provider will be responsible for the design, procurement, construction, and
installation of all network upgrades and terms and conditions by which the affected
system interconnection customer will initially fund, and be reimbursed for, the cost of
any assigned affected system network upgrades. As described below, we modify the
following proposed articles in the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement: (1) article 2.2.2 (Termination Upon Default); (2) article 2.2.3 (Consequences
of Termination); (3) article 3.1.1 (Transmission Provider Obligations); (4) article 3.1.2.1

Utilities explains, the adoption of a pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement will offer uniformity of these types of agreements to be tendered by affected
system transmission providers across the country.2337 Such uniformity will help reduce
the potential for undue discrimination. As the Commission found in Order No. 2003, a
standard set of procedures as part of the tariff for all jurisdictional transmission facilities
will minimize opportunities for undue discrimination.2338
We also adopt a pro forma multiparty affected system facilities construction
agreement.2339 Similar to adopting the pro forma multiparty affected system study
agreement, as discussed earlier, we find that the adoption of the pro forma multiparty
affected system facilities construction agreement will further improve coordination and
further minimize opportunities for undue discrimination, even relative to a two-party
agreement. Also, similar to the adoption of the pro forma affected system study
agreement, the establishment of the pro forma multiparty affected system facilities
construction agreement aligns with the requirement to study affected system
interconnection requests in clusters. Specifically, such a multiparty agreement will allow
for a common agreement for the affected system transmission provider to enter into with
all affected system interconnection customers for the construction of affected system

network upgrades identified by the cluster study that are assigned to more than one
affected system interconnection customer. Below, in discussing relevant article-specific
comments, we discuss noteworthy, additional changes needed to convert the pro forma
affected system facilities construction agreement from a two-party agreement to a
multiparty agreement.
As with the pro forma multiparty affected system study agreement, discussed
above, the pro forma multiparty affected system facilities construction agreement that we
adopt in this final rule closely follows the two-party agreement, with changes needed to
convert to a multiparty agreement. In article 2.2.2 (Termination Upon Default), we
establish that the default by one affected system interconnection customer does not allow
the non-defaulting affected system interconnection customer(s) the right to terminate the
agreement and that, instead, the defaulting party may be removed from the agreement by
the affected system transmission provider. In article 3.1.2.1 (Right to Suspend), we
maintain the affected system interconnection customer’s right to suspend but only upon
the mutual agreement of all affected system interconnection customers that are party to
the multiparty agreement. In article 5.3 (Notice of Breach, Cure, and Default), we
establish multiparty cure procedures whereby the non-breaching parties may cure the
other affected system interconnection customer’s breach.
We decline to make changes to the proposed pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement and conforming changes to the pro forma LGIP, aligning with
Xcel’s suggestion that the “affected system transmission provider” should be renamed an
“affected system operator.” Instead, we clarify that the pro forma LGIP is written for a

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

specific transmission provider. When a transmission provider is fulfilling its obligations
as a host transmission provider, the pro forma LGIP refers to the host transmission
provider’s interaction with the “affected system operator.” However, when the pro forma
LGIP references a transmission provider and its obligations as the operator of an affected
system, we use the term “transmission provider,” as the pro forma LGIP is setting the
requirements of the transmission provider, whether acting as the host or affected system
transmission provider, and that is a different perspective from a host transmission
provider’s interaction with a separate “affected system operator.”
In response to Tri-State’s suggestion to revise proposed article 2 of the pro forma
affected system facilities construction agreement to clarify that the execution of an LGIA
does not convey transmission service, we decline to adopt this request, as it is
unnecessary.2340 However, we accept Tri-State’s suggested revisions to article 3.1.1 of
the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement to clarify that the affected
system transmission provider shall not undertake any actions inconsistent with its safety
practices, material and equipment specifications, design criteria and construction
procedures, labor agreements, or any applicable laws and regulations.

We modify proposed articles 2.2.2 and 5.2 (now articles 2.2.2 and 5.3) of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement in response to comments from
Southern and Tri-State regarding termination and cure. Proposed article 2.2.2 establishes
that a non-breaching party has the right to terminate the pro forma affected system
facilities construction agreement, provided that termination does not pose a reliability
threat and that the breaching party has not undertaken efforts to cure the breach, pursuant
to article 5.3 (Notice of Breach, Cure and Default). However, consistent with comments
from Southern,2341 we agree that termination and default rights in the pro forma affected
system facilities construction agreement should be consistent with the pro forma LGIA.
Accordingly, as adopted, we modify articles 2.2.2 and 5.2 (now articles 2.2.2 and 5.3) of
the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement to make them consistent
with the existing default provisions in article 17 of the pro forma LGIA (Default), which
also establishes default and cure provisions in the event of a breach.
We also modify proposed article 2.2.3 (Consequences of Termination) of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement in response to comments from
Tri-State and Invenergy suggesting that it would require affected system interconnection
customers to be responsible for the costs of additional facilities that are caused by another
interconnection customer terminating its affected system facilities construction agreement
or that interconnection customer’s LGIA.2342 Specifically, we remove the final sentence

from proposed article 2.2.3 that an “affected system interconnection customer is
responsible for the cost of additional facilities that is caused to another interconnection
customer due to the termination of this Agreement, affected system interconnection
customer’s LGIA, or any affected system interconnection customer’s other Affected
System Facilities Construction Agreement(s).” We find that deletion of this sentence is
needed because the affected system interconnection customer should not be responsible
for any additional facilities that are assigned to another interconnection customer under
these circumstances. As written, the provision implies that an affected system
interconnection customer could be responsible for any network upgrade identified as a
result of the agreement’s termination, even if the newly assigned network upgrade is on a
different transmission provider’s transmission system than the transmission provider that
is a signatory to the terminated agreement. Additionally, we note that the pro forma
LGIA contains no similar requirement that upon termination of an LGIA that the
interconnection customer is responsible for any additional costs assigned to another
interconnection customer as a result of the LGIA’s termination and based on the
comments received, the record does not support including the provision.
MISO requests a cross-default provision between the pro forma affected system
facilities construction agreement and the pro forma LGIA because MISO asserts that, if
an affected system interconnection customer does not meet its obligations under its
affected system facilities construction agreement, it is unclear how that would affect that

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

interconnection customer’s LGIA on its host transmission system.2343 In response, we
clarify that a breach under the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement does not constitute a breach under the pro forma LGIA. We are unpersuaded
that cross-default provisions between the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement and the pro forma LGIA are necessary because both the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement and the pro forma LGIA
individually already contain default provisions.
In addition, we are concerned that a cross-default provision, which could result in
the termination of an interconnection customer’s interconnection service based on actions
under a separate agreement, could raise contractual complications because the host
transmission provider will not be a party to the affected system facilities construction
agreement. We note, however, that any affected system interconnection customer that
defaults on its obligations under the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement may face consequences, including, for example, curtailment. Additionally, we
find that article 4.1 of the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement
already contains sufficient security provisions to protect a transmission provider in the
situation that the affected system interconnection customer defaults on the agreement and
which discourages non-payment by the interconnection customer.
We modify proposed article 3.1.2.1 (Right to Suspend for Force Majeure Event)
of the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement in response to

comments that the proposed suspension provision is too restrictive and inconsistent with
the suspension provision in the pro forma LGIA.2344 Specifically, we revise article
3.1.2.1 to remove the limitation on the right to suspend to force majeure events and
modify the suspension provision to allow an affected system interconnection customer to
suspend work required under the affected system facilities construction agreement for up
to three years.2345 We also modify article 3.1.2.1 to remove the requirement for the
affected system interconnection customer, prior to suspension, to provide security to the
affected system transmission provider of the higher of $5 million or the total cost of all
affected system network upgrades listed in Appendix A of the agreement. We find the
requirement unnecessary because, under article 4.1 (Provision of Security) of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement, the affected system
interconnection customer would have already been required to provide security for the
applicable portion of the affected system network upgrades. With these changes to article
3.1.2.1, the suspension provision in the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement will mirror the suspension provision in the pro forma LGIA.2346
Additionally, we revise proposed article 3.1.2.3 (Right to Suspend Due to Default)
of the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement, which provides for the

2344

right to suspend due to default. The revisions we adopt to this provision clarify that if an
affected system interconnection customer defaults, the affected system interconnection
customer will be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by the affected system
transmission provider associated with the construction and installation of the affected
system network upgrades, as set forth in article 2.2.3 (Consequences of Termination).
We find that the revisions will align the language in the pro forma affected system
facilities construction agreement with similar language in the pro forma LGIP, as
suggested by PacifiCorp.2347 However, we reject the proposed revisions suggested by
Tri-State to article 3.1.2.3 because they would alter the right to suspend to allow an
affected system transmission provider the right to suspend in the event of a breach, rather
than in the event of a default. Tri-State’s suggested changes to article 3.1.2.3 would
contradict other provisions in the pro forma LGIA and the pro forma affected system
facilities construction agreement, which allow for the breaching party to cure a breach as
is appropriate.
We adopt article 3.2.2.1 (Repayment) of the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement as proposed, which is consistent with existing Commission
precedent.2348

Some commenters are concerned that affected systems repayment could force
affected system transmission providers to subsidize interconnection to neighboring
systems, stifle renewable generating facility development, or facilitate inefficient
siting.2349 However, in the NOPR, the Commission did not propose to change the
Commission’s affected system repayment policy; instead, the Commission simply
proposed to memorialize the Commission’s existing policy in a pro forma agreement for
affected systems.2350 As a result, we decline to address arguments on the merits of the
Commission’s affected systems repayment policy in this final rule.
With respect to the concerns raised by WAPA that it is unable to repay affected
system interconnection customers due to limitations based on its federal status, we
decline to rule on the specifics of individual transmission provider circumstances and
instead find that such concerns are better raised in a compliance proceeding, including
such a proceeding with a reciprocity tariff filing, if WAPA chooses to file one.
In response to requests for clarification from Southern, we clarify that, consistent

requiring the interconnection customer, at its expense, to install, operate, and maintain
system protection facilities as a part of its generating facility or its interconnection
facilities.2351 Also in response to Southern and consistent with the Commission’s
findings in Order No. 2003, transmission providers may make a filing to the Commission
proposing an incremental rate to the affected system interconnection customer, as more
fully described in Order Nos. 2003-A and 2003-B,2352 if native load and existing
transmission customers are not being held harmless, though we reiterate that the
transmission provider bears the full burden of showing that any such proposal is just,
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential and is appropriate under the
circumstances.2353
We adopt Tri-State’s suggested revisions to proposed article 3.2.2.1 of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement regarding the terms for
repayment of affected system network upgrades. Consistent with existing pro forma
LGIA provisions,2354 the parties may mutually agree to a repayment schedule for all

repayment not to exceed 20 years from the commercial operation date of the affected
system interconnection customer’s generating facility.
We decline to adopt additions to proposed article 4.1 (Provision of Security) of the
pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement suggested by PacifiCorp that
would add additional security posting requirements, to the extent that costs to construct
affected system network upgrades increase.2355 Proposed article 4.1 is consistent with
security provisions outlined in pro forma LGIA article 11.5 (Provision of Security), and
we find that such provisions should be consistent across both the pro forma affected
system facilities construction agreement and the pro forma LGIA. We also find that the
security provision requirements are already sufficiently clear in article 4.1 of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement. Specifically, article 4.1 of the
pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement provides that “security for
payment shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the costs for constructing, procuring
and installing the applicable portion of Affected System Network Upgrades.”
In response to comments from PPL asserting that affected system interconnection
customers should be responsible for meeting the affected system transmission provider’s
creditworthiness requirements,2356 because the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement is an agreement between the affected system transmission
provider and the affected system interconnection customer, we clarify that affected

system interconnection customers are obligated to meet the affected system transmission
provider’s creditworthiness and security requirements. We note that this is consistent
with the parallel requirement for interconnection customers to meet the creditworthiness
and security requirements of the host transmission provider outlined in pro forma LGIA
article 11.5.1.
We revise proposed article 5.1(b) of the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement, consistent with PacifiCorp’s suggestion, to remove the
requirement that a party will be in breach for failure to comply with a material term or
condition of the agreement due to an inaccuracy in a representation, warranty, or
covenant made in the agreement resulting in a breach under the agreement. We find that
there is no reason why an inaccuracy should lead to a potential breach, or even a default,
under the agreement. We note that the pro forma LGIA contains no similar provision.
We revise proposed article 5.2.1, now article 5.3.1, of the pro forma affected

calendar days to 60 calendar days and proposed article 5.2.2, now article 5.3.2, of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement to remove the additional cure
period if the breach remains despite the occurrence of good faith steps. We find that the
revision will simplify the cure requirements while providing breaching party with an
extra 30 calendar days at the onset to cure its breach. We also revise article 5.3.2 to
include a reference that if the breaching party defaults, then the non-defaulting party may
terminate the agreement in accordance with article 6.2 (Termination) of the agreement.
We further clarify article 5 of both the pro forma affected system facilities construction

agreement and the pro forma multiparty affected system facilities construction agreement
that a failure to cure a breach of either agreement will also constitute a default.
We decline to delete proposed article 6.4 (Survival of Rights) of the pro forma
affected system facilities construction agreement, as suggested by Tri-State. Although
Tri-State asserts that proposed article 6.4 should be deleted because it is duplicative of
proposed article 2.4 (Survival),2357 we find that the contents are sufficiently different to
merit their separate inclusion. Specifically, article 2.4 provides for the survival of the pro
forma affected system facilities construction agreement until all liabilities incurred prior
to termination are fulfilled, whereas article 6.4 clarifies the scope of the rights of parties
following termination to provide for final billing, enforcement of liabilities and
confidentiality obligations, and for potential judicial or administrative action.
In response to comments from Southern regarding updates to the confidentiality
provisions contained in proposed article 8 (Confidentiality) of the pro forma affected
system facilities construction agreement,2358 we find that, because we are not proposing
to revise the confidentiality provision set forth in the pro forma LGIA—instead, we are
merely adopting it into the pro forma affected system facilities construction agreement—
article 8, as adopted, is just and reasonable. Contrary to Southern’s comments, the
confidentiality provisions in article 8.1.7 of the pro forma affected system facilities
construction agreement allow for confidential information to be destroyed, erased,

deleted or, as applicable, returned, not for such information to exclusively be “destroyed
or returned.”2359 Thus, such language reflects the fact that most electronic information is
stored in backup servers. Moreover, in response to Southern’s concern that deleting
information stored on backup servers is administratively difficult, we find that Southern
has not provided any evidence or explained why this might be so.
In response to MISO’s contention that there is no need to list a commercial
operation date for affected system network upgrades in Appendix A of the pro forma
affected system facilities construction agreement,2360 we agree and modify Appendix A,
now Attachment A, to remove the commercial operation date from tables 1 and 3.
However, we note that parties may find it useful to memorialize the commercial
operation date for the affected system interconnection customer’s generating facility
because, under article 2.2.1 of the pro forma affected system facilities construction
agreement, the parties to the agreement may alter the affected system facilities
construction agreement by mutual consent if the in-service state date for the affected
system network upgrades or the commercial operation date for the generating facility
changes. To the extent MISO is concerned that there could be different commercial
operation dates listed for affected system network upgrades in the LGIA and the affected
system facilities construction agreement, the host transmission provider must update the
commercial operation date for affected system network upgrades in the affected system

the affected system facilities construction agreement and the LGIA.
Finally, in response to comments from Eversource and ISO-NE,2361 we clarify that
these pro forma affected system agreements are distinct from intra-RTO/ISO agreements,
like ISO-NE’s RFA, which RTOs/ISOs may use to coordinate the construction of
necessary network upgrades within multiple transmission owner service territories within
the same RTO/ISO.2362

Affected System Modeling and Study Assumptions
i.

NOPR Proposal

As the Commission explained in the NOPR, when an interconnection customer
submits an interconnection request, they must choose to be studied as ERIS or NRIS,
depending on the level of deliverability they seek for the output of their generating
facility. For interconnection customers seeking to deliver their generating facility’s
electric output using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the transmission provider’s
system on an as-available basis, the interconnection customer will choose an ERIS study.
An interconnection customer will choose an NRIS study when seeking to integrate their
generating facility with the transmission provider’s system (1) in a manner comparable to
that in which the transmission provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native
load customers or (2) in an RTO/ISO with market-based congestion management, in the

same manner as network resources.2363 An NRIS study goes beyond the prerequisite
ERIS study and uses stricter modeling standards2364 to assess an interconnection request
to ensure that the interconnection customer’s electric output is deliverable to load in
aggregate on the host transmission provider’s system.2365 Such a deliverability analysis
varies regionally but can analyze anything from various stressed dispatch scenarios to an

“Network Resource shall mean any designated generating resource owned,
purchased, or leased by a Network Customer under the Network Integration Transmission
Service Tariff. Network Resources do not include any resource, or any portion thereof,
that is committed for sale to third parties or otherwise cannot be called upon to meet the
Network Customer’s Network Load on a non-interruptible basis.” Pro forma LGIP
section 1; pro forma LGIA art. 1.
2364

NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 210. The term “modeling standard” refers to
the distribution factor threshold on a transmission element used by transmission
providers, such that beyond this threshold an interconnection request will require network
upgrades. For example, in SPP, if a transmission element is found to be overloaded in an
interconnection study, and an NRIS interconnection request has over a 3% distribution
factor on that element (3% being SPP’s distribution factor threshold for NRIS requests),
the requesting entity will be assigned network upgrades. SPP uses a 19.5% distribution
factor threshold for ERIS requests. See EDF Renewable Energy, Inc. v. Midcontinent
Indep. Sys. Operator, Inc., 168 FERC ¶ 61,173 at P 17. A lower threshold indicates a
stricter modeling standard because a smaller impact triggers network upgrades.
Additionally, when conducting an affected system analysis, although some RTOs/ISOs
(PJM and SPP, for example) use a modeling standard associated with the same level of
service as requested on the host transmission provider’s transmission system, the output
of proposed generating facilities is always sunk into the host transmission provider’s
transmission system by reducing the output of other generating facilities on that system.
Id. P 85.
2365

See Order No. 2003, 104 FERC ¶ 61,103 at P 768; Order No. 2003-A, 106
FERC ¶ 61,220 at P 500. Specifically, a transmission provider studying generating
facility for NRIS would study the transmission system at peak load, under a variety of
severely stressed conditions to determine whether, with the generating facility operating
at full output, the aggregate of generation in the local area can be delivered to the
aggregate of load, consistent with reliability criteria and procedures.

additional set of contingencies. As such, an NRIS study will likely identify more
network upgrades to accommodate the interconnection of a generating facility than an
ERIS study because NRIS provides a higher level of interconnection service than ERIS.
As the Commission also explained in the NOPR, when a host transmission
provider notifies an affected system operator of a possible impact on its system from an
interconnection request in the host’s queue, it must specify whether the interconnection
customer requested ERIS or NRIS. Currently, there is no requirement for affected
system transmission providers to apply either ERIS or NRIS modeling standards to study
interconnection requests made on neighboring systems. For example, MISO uses ERIS
studies for all affected system interconnection requests, while PJM and SPP use the
modeling standard associated with the level of service requested on the host system.
(They study ERIS requests as ERIS and NRIS requests as NRIS.)2366
In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that it was unjust and
unreasonable for an affected system transmission provider to study interconnection
requests on other transmission systems using NRIS modeling standards, regardless of the
level of service requested on the host transmission system. The Commission noted that,
unlike the host transmission provider with which the affected system interconnection
customer will directly interconnect, an affected system transmission provider does not
have a continuing obligation to operate its system so that NRIS resources will remain

deliverable on the host system. Without such an obligation, the Commission stated that
an affected system interconnection customer may be required to construct significant
network upgrades on the transmission provider’s affected system, but not be fully
deliverable due to curtailment or congestion on the affected system. The Commission
was concerned that this could result in unjust and unreasonable rates by increasing the
costs for the interconnection customer without a commensurate increase in service.
The Commission proposed to require, under new pro forma LGIP section 9.6,2367
the affected system transmission provider to study interconnection requests using ERIS
modeling standards, regardless of the requested level of service on the host transmission
provider’s transmission system.2368
The Commission also explained that if an affected system transmission provider
believed that it was necessary to study an interconnection request that is requesting
NRIS-level service using NRIS modeling standards, such a transmission provider could
make a filing under FPA section 205. The Commission explained that it would evaluate
such case-by-case FPA section 205 filings to determine whether they were just,
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.2369 The Commission noted that
an affected system transmission provider making this type of filing should provide

evidence indicating that using NRIS modeling standards in such a scenario would not
treat similarly situated customers differently or afford similar treatment to dissimilar
customers. In addition, this FPA section 205 filing could contain, for example, such
supporting documentation as a reference to a NERC Reliability Standard violation, an
operational concern such as over-duty breakers, fault current violations, impacts on
transmission stability, increased loop flows, or other concerns that implicate any other
critical reliability parameters.
The Commission stated that a modeling standard would create consistency in the
modeling standards used across all transmission regions.2370 The Commission also stated
that ERIS modeling standards generally reduce the number and cost of network upgrades
identified and, by using ERIS modeling standards, interconnection customers would be
subject to fewer late-stage cost increases, which would reduce the number of potential
restudies and withdrawals thereby addressing the concerns that the Commission has
preliminarily found to result in unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or
preferential Commission-jurisdictional rates. The Commission acknowledged that using
a less stringent modeling standard may result in more frequent redispatch or curtailment
by not fully capturing all the potential impacts of the interconnection generating
facility(ies) on an affected system.2371 Nevertheless, the Commission stated that it

The Commission noted that, while this proposal would standardize the use of
ERIS for affected system studies, individual transmission providers use different specific
thresholds for ERIS studies. NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 212 n.292.

believed that these risks were limited in nature and any significant impact would be
captured by an ERIS study, which would ensure that a proposed generating facility can
safely connect the affected system under the expectation it will deliver its electric output
using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the affected system transmission
provider’s system on an as-available basis.
The Commission sought comment on: (1) how to align the possibility for such
case-by-case FPA section 205 filings with the required timeline for the affected system
study and other deadlines proposed in the NOPR; (2) whether the proposed reform will
adversely affect reliability for the affected system transmission provider or the host
transmission provider; (3) the potential impact of requiring affected system transmission
providers to use ERIS modeling standards when an interconnection customer seeks NRIS
on the host transmission provider’s system; and (4) whether there are modifications to
this proposal that would reduce the likelihood of curtailment or redispatch on the affected
system transmission provider’s system without requiring the affected system
interconnection customer to pay network upgrade costs that are not commensurate with
the level of service it receives.2372

Comments in Support

Numerous commenters support the NOPR proposal.2373 ELCON suggests that
standardization of affected system modeling and assumptions furthers certainty and
accountability, resulting in a more transparent, efficient, and cost-effective
interconnection process.2374 Some commenters argue that the NOPR proposal will reduce
the identification and assignment of unnecessary affected system network upgrades under
NRIS studies.2375 MISO and Shell contend that ERIS modeling will adequately cover
reliability for affected systems and that they have no significant concerns regarding
unnecessary curtailment or redispatch on affected systems associated with ERIS
modeling.2376 Additionally, commenters contend that there is no need to use NRIS
modeling standards when the affected system interconnection customer requests NRISlevel service on the host system because the generating facility’s output will not be
delivered to the affected system, and the NRIS standard serves the exclusive purpose of

allowing interconnection customers to be designated as a network resource on the host

Some commenters oppose the NOPR proposal.2379 AECI claims that, without
increasing the granularity of the redispatch and curtailment process in real time to better

disproportionate burdens by reducing otherwise economical and reliable generating
facilities to accommodate resources that are outside an affected system transmission
provider’s control.2380 Idaho Power asserts that the NOPR proposal may not sufficiently

capture network upgrades that are jointly owned by multiple entities.2381 Specifically,
Idaho Power states that the host transmission provider “may not be the entity responsible
for designing and constructing network upgrades and interconnection facilities; therefore,
the affected party ERIS study may not provide sufficient details to be meaningful.”2382
Several commenters claim that the ERIS modeling requirement for affected
systems will negatively impact reliability.2383 AECI argues that incentivizing ERIS-only
studies would fundamentally affect reliability by failing to address systemic de minimis
issues that become material in the aggregate.2384 Some commenters contend that, under
the NOPR proposal, reliability issues will not arise until the operational time horizon,
which could, as an example, result in an increase in transmission loading relief events and
redispatch of network resources and native load.2385 LADWP asserts that the dispatching
assumptions of an interconnection request can make a significant difference to flow
patterns in the host system, and parallel paths will inherently absorb the unscheduled flow
intended for the host system.2386 LADWP contends that, as the number of

interconnection requests continues to grow, these unscheduled flows will continue to
increase and begin to affect systems downstream of the affected system, rather than just
the local transmission system that the ERIS modeling standard is designed to evaluate.
LADWP claims that the NOPR proposal would result in approval of generating facilities
without identification of sufficient network upgrades to accommodate requested
interconnection service, and affected system transmission providers would be responsible
for maintaining reliability by developing operating procedures, capital projects, or
performing curtailments from the additional stress of energy that is not being delivered to
the affected system.
AEP, SPP, and Xcel express concern that the proposed ERIS modeling standard
may harm firm transmission service on the affected system.2387 AEP, NRECA, and Xcel
argue that affected system transmission providers should be able to use NRIS in affected
system studies if the affected system interconnection customer is requesting NRIS-level
service on the host transmission system to ensure the required level of deliverability.2388
AEP states that, in the case that the interconnection customer is requesting to interconnect
to a different RTO/ISO or is in a non-RTO/ISO, then an ERIS-only modeling standard
could result in the failure to construct affected system network upgrades to mitigate

congestion and/or loop flow once the new generating facility commences operation,
impacting loads that secured and paid for firm transmission service and/or NRIS. 2389
SPP is concerned that, if an affected system interconnection customer requests
NRIS-level service on the host transmission system that grants deliverability rights
without additional study procedures, an affected system may be exposed to impacts that it
has not had an opportunity to evaluate under an ERIS modeling standard.2390 As an
example, SPP explains that SPP and MISO treat what constitutes firm transmission
service differently, but SPP’s current ability to conduct affected system studies under
NRIS when the interconnection customer has requested NRIS on the host system allows
for that difference. In response to SPP’s concerns, NextEra argues that this issue appears
to be a problem of SPP’s own making based on how SPP implemented ERIS and NRIS
on its own system and ignores that affected system interconnection customers are not
seeking deliverability or to be deemed firm on SPP’s transmission system through any
sort of transmission service from SPP.2391

non-RTO/ISO regions, if these impacts are not addressed through a coordinated
transmission service study.2393 Xcel believes that the use of ERIS modeling standards for
affected system studies may be appropriate under a joint operating agreement or in areas
where the impact may be evaluated and mitigated in the transmission service study
process, but in other areas, if the impact will not be evaluated in the transmission service
study process, it is appropriate for an affected system transmission provider to model the
neighbor’s NRIS requests based on the expected delivery point.2394

Comments on Specific Proposal

Some commenters ask the Commission to make changes to the NOPR proposal to
mitigate the negative impacts they discuss in their comments. For example, some
commenters recommend that, in addition to the ERIS modeling standard, the
Commission should establish (or allow affected system transmission providers to
establish) a distribution factor or impact threshold for affected system studies to ensure
that affected system interconnection customers are not assigned unnecessary affected
system network upgrades.2395 NextEra recommends that the use of ERIS be included in

transmission provider proposing to use NRIS rather than ERIS to file such agreement
with the Commission on a non-conforming basis.2396
Enel states that a critical interconnection issue not addressed in the NOPR is the
lack of clarification of ERIS and NRIS-level service and how the different assumptions
used by transmission providers significantly alter results.2397 Enel explains that the wide
variety of views on what rights interconnection service grants to an interconnection
customer leads to confusion in the development of study practices and requirements, as
well as the services and products a generating facility can provide. Enel requests that, in
a final rule or a supplemental notice, the Commission should provide concrete direction
regarding how these service types should be studied and what outcome an
interconnection customer should receive for making the necessary transmission system
improvements to obtain that interconnection service. NV Energy requests that affected
system transmission providers and host transmission providers coordinate assumptions
for affected system studies and update those assumptions quarterly after the affected
system study has been issued to provide meaningful changes.2398

Some commenters note that a final rule should provide host transmission providers
with flexibility to work with their neighboring regions to address modeling consistencies
in transmission system representations across regions.2399
Some commenters specifically support allowing transmission providers to use
NRIS modeling standards for affected system studies pursuant to separate FPA section
205 filings, as proposed in the NOPR.2400 Duke Southeast Utilities assert that the
Commission should remove any negative repercussions, including any financial penalties
or liability for breaching deadlines of the study process, for affected system transmission
providers that seek to make such FPA section 205 filings.2401
Several commenters argue that affected system transmission providers should be
able to use NRIS when conducting affected system studies without requiring the NOPR’s
proposed FPA section 205 filing.2402 A few commenters argue that the requirement to
make an FPA section 205 filing to use NRIS modeling standards will create delays and is
overly burdensome on affected system transmission providers.2403 SPP claims that, as

proposed in the NOPR, an FPA section 205 filing to use NRIS modeling assumptions
would require supporting documentation amounting to evidence that the affected system
transmission provider could only obtain if it conducted a study using the standards of the
heightened level of service, which it could not do absent the Commission’s grant of a
waiver to require such a study.2404 Invenergy argues that the option for an FPA section
205 request to conduct an affected system study using NRIS criteria invites case-by-case
disputes over modeling criteria, potentially delaying the affected system study process.
Therefore, Invenergy argues that the Commission should clarify that any such filing must
be limited to only the facts of an individual interconnection request.2405
Xcel states that the Commission should: (1) remove the ERIS option in RTO/ISO
markets and require all generating facilities in such markets to be deliverable; (2) curtail
generating facilities that did not pay for long-term firm transmission service; or (3)
convene a technical conference on this topic in this docket.2406 Xcel explains that ERISonly generating facilities in RTO/ISO markets may place a bid to sell into the market, and
the ERIS-only generating facilities will be dispatched to the extent a bid clears, while in
other areas, the ERIS-only generating facilities must acquire transmission service to be

and unreasonable rates and discriminatory treatment because ERIS-level generating
facilities do not bear the costs necessary to ensure that they are deliverable to load. Xcel
claims that: (1) the affected system transmission provider should not have to assume it
will redispatch its own network resources to accommodate an affected system
interconnection customer taking NRIS-level service; (2) the affected system’s network
resources paid for and expect to receive firm transmission service; and (3) there is no
process for a host transmission provider to require an affected system transmission
provider to redispatch its transmission system to accommodate a generating facility on
the host system under the pro forma tariff.2408
NRECA asserts that the final rule should allow a “transmission customer” to
propose a different standard through an FPA section 206 complaint.2409 NextEra and
MISO suggest that, to avoid delays in the interconnection process, any affected system
transmission provider submitting an FPA section 205 filing to use NRIS modeling in an
affected system study should proceed with the affected system study, using both the ERIS
and NRIS standards, and then the appropriate results could be used based on the outcome
of the FPA section 205 proceeding.2410 MISO also encourages the Commission to

Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal, with modification, to add section 9.7 to the pro
forma LGIP to require affected system transmission providers to study all affected system
interconnection requests using ERIS modeling standards.2412 We decline to adopt the
NOPR proposal to expressly acknowledge in pro forma LGIP section 9.7 that an affected
system transmission provider may submit an FPA section 205 filing to request to study an
affected system interconnection customer using NRIS on a case-by-case basis.
We find that the use of ERIS in affected system studies is just and reasonable,
given that the affected system transmission provider has no obligation to continually
ensure deliverability for an affected system interconnection customer that has obtained
NRIS on its host system. An NRIS study goes beyond the prerequisite ERIS study and
uses stricter modeling standards to assess an interconnection request to ensure that the
interconnection customer’s electric output is deliverable to load in aggregate on the host

In relevant part, pro forma LGIP section 9.7 states: “Transmission Provider
must study an Affected System Interconnection Customer using the Energy Resource
Interconnection Service modeling standard used for Interconnection Requests on its own
Transmission System, regardless of the level of interconnection service that Affected
System Interconnection Customer is seeking from the host transmission provider with
whom it seeks to interconnect.”

transmission provider’s transmission system.2413 We find that the use of ERIS for
affected system studies is consistent with Order No. 2003 because interconnection is
separate from the deliverability component of transmission service.2414
We also find that this requirement is likely to prevent an affected system
interconnection customer from being required to construct significant network upgrades
on the transmission provider’s affected system, but not being deliverable due to
curtailment or congestion on the affected system. Without this reform, rates would
continue to be unjust and unreasonable because an affected system interconnection
customer would face increased costs without a commensurate increase in service, as
explained in the NOPR. This mismatch between costs and services received would occur
because the affected system transmission provider has no obligation to ensure that the
output from the affected system interconnection customer’s generating facility is
deliverable on the affected system and could lead to curtailment of the generating facility,
or there could be congestion on the affected system preventing deliverability of the
generating facility’s output.

2413

See Order No. 2003, 104 FERC ¶ 61,103 at P 768; Order No. 2003-A, 106
FERC ¶ 61,220 at P 500. Specifically, a transmission provider studying a generating
facility for NRIS would study the transmission system at peak load, under a variety of
severely stressed conditions to determine whether, with the generating facility operating
at full output, the aggregate of generation in the local area can be delivered to the
aggregate of load, consistent with reliability criteria and procedures.

We also find that, if the affected system transmission provider were able to study
affected system interconnection customers under an NRIS standard, it could require
affected system interconnection customers to pay significant upfront costs in order to
construct the required affected system network upgrades, which could lead to late-stage
interconnection request withdrawals as interconnection customers will not receive
affected system study results until late in the interconnection process. An ERIS standard
ensures that the assigned affected system network upgrade costs will likely be lower and
that affected system interconnection customers assigned affected system network
upgrades will be less likely to withdraw at a late stage. This standard will help prevent
the cascading restudies that commenters have observed2415 and will ensure that the
interconnection process operates more efficiently.
We also find that the use of ERIS in affected system study processes across all
transmission provider regions will create consistency and provide transparency for
affected system interconnection customers. Currently, similarly situated interconnection
customers requesting NRIS on their host transmission systems could have disparate
impacts on affected systems that use different modeling standards, and these
interconnection customers could be assigned dramatically different affected system
network upgrade costs due to those varying modeling standards, without any factual or
service differences to justify the discriminatory treatment. Thus, the consistent
application of ERIS in affected system studies across all transmission providers’ study

processes will ensure that all affected system interconnection customers are studied
similarly.2416 As such, we agree with commenters that the use of ERIS on all affected
system interconnection requests will increase certainty and transparency.2417
We find outside the scope of this final rule Xcel’s request that the Commission
require all generating facilities in RTO/ISO markets to be deliverable and its claim that
ERIS-level generating facilities do not bear the costs necessary to ensure that they are
deliverable to load.2418 We are not proposing in this final rule to alter how an
interconnection customer in an RTO/ISO requests its type of interconnection service on
the host system (i.e., ERIS or NRIS); rather, we are standardizing how an affected system
transmission provider studies an affected system interconnection request.
Regarding AECI’s claim that the NOPR proposal would produce disproportionate
burdens by necessitating curtailment from economical and reliable generating facilities to
accommodate generating facilities on a different transmission system unless overall
granularity of the redispatch and curtailment process is increased in real time, we find no
evidence of this concern, from AECI or otherwise.2419 Rather, AECI appears concerned

that generating facilities on its transmission system may be redispatched and curtailed,
which we have acknowledged may occur.2420 Additionally, we note the transmission
loading relief procedures set the priority for curtailing generating facilities as necessary,
and this final rule is not revising those procedures. Finally, to the extent that the costs
associated with increasing the overall granularity of real-time models is less than any
hypothetical increase in curtailment and redispatch costs, a transmission provider may
increase the real-time granularity of its model.
Further, we find that Idaho Power has not adequately explained how this reform
will result in insufficiently identifying network upgrades that are jointly owned by
multiple entities.2421 Moreover, even if this were a valid concern, we find that this
concern would be equally present regardless of the modeling standard (i.e., ERIS or
NRIS) used to conduct the affected system study.
As discussed in the NOPR proposal, using a less stringent modeling standard may
result in more frequent redispatch or curtailment by not fully capturing all the potential
impacts of the affected system interconnection customer’s generating facility(ies) on an
affected system. Based on the record, we continue to find that these risks are limited in
nature, particularly in non-RTO/ISO regions where interconnection service does not, by
itself, allow a generating facility’s power to flow. In non-RTO/ISO regions, power can
only flow from a generating facility once transmission service has been requested and

granted. For example, once point-to-point transmission service has been requested to
enable a particular generating facility’s power to flow, either by the generating facility
itself or its power sale customer, pro forma open access transmission tariff section 21
(Provisions Relating to Transmission Construction and Services on the Systems of Other
Utilities) provides a process similar to the affected system process in the pro forma LGIP.
In summary, pro forma open access transmission tariff section 21 makes the transmission
customer responsible for obtaining any necessary engineering, permitting, and
construction of transmission or distribution facilities on the system(s) of utilities other
than the directly connected transmission provider, but requires that transmission provider
to undertake reasonable efforts to assist in that effort. This means that affected systems
will have another opportunity to study the impact of the interconnection customer’s
generating facility in the context of this transmission service request, whether a new
point-to-point transmission service request or designation as a new network resource
under an existing transmission customer’s network integration transmission service,
before any power can flow from the generating facility.
Moreover, we find that any significant impact would generally be captured by an
ERIS study, which would ensure that any reliability impacts on the affected system are
mitigated to accommodate the interconnection of the affected system interconnection
customer’s proposed generating facility to the host system. That ERIS adequately studies
an affected system interconnection customer’s interconnection request for its reliability

impacts on the affected system is evidenced by MISO’s use of only ERIS in affected
system studies without adverse reliability impacts.2422
Regarding AECI’s claim that using only ERIS in affected system studies may
result in increased de minimis impacts,2423 we are not setting the implementation of the
ERIS standard. Rather, each transmission provider determines its own implementation of
that standard, which could include a de minimis threshold that is best for its region. The
Commission has found that, if consistently applied, it is reasonable for interconnection
customers to not bear cost responsibility for de minimis impacts on transmission facilities
based on a threshold.2424 Additionally, we expect that any overloads in the models due to
the accumulation of de minimis impacts will ultimately be assigned, pursuant to the
transmission provider’s tariff, when an interconnection customer triggers the need for a
network upgrade or when the transmission provider’s reliability transmission planning
process identifies the need for mitigation.
We disagree with LADWP that the use of ERIS by an affected system
transmission provider will result in approval of generating facilities with insufficient
network upgrades identified.2425 As discussed above, we find that, in general, the use of

ERIS is sufficient for affected system studies to prevent reliability issues from occurring
on the affected system. Moreover, as noted earlier, in non-RTO/ISO regions, power can
only flow from a generating facility once transmission service has been requested and
granted, meaning that affected systems will have another opportunity to study the impact
of the interconnection customer’s generating facility in the context of the associated
transmission service request before any power can flow from that generating facility as
explained above.
Similarly, we find that commenters’ concerns about harm to firm transmission
service and cost shifting when using ERIS in affected system studies are misplaced
because those concerns do not arise until the interconnection customer seeks to deliver
power from its generating facility to a customer, which outside of RTO/ISO regions can
only happen once transmission service is separately secured.2426 In Order No. 2003, the
Commission found that interconnection service is separate from the delivery component
of transmission service, and, in the majority of circumstances, interconnection alone is
unlikely to affect the reliability of an affected system transmission provider’s
transmission system.2427 Additionally, the Commission found that holding new
interconnection customers responsible for network upgrades to all interconnected
systems, including not only the transmission system to which the generating facility

interconnects, but other, more distant transmission systems as well would create an
unreasonable obstacle to the construction of new generation.2428 As such, if an affected
system interconnection customer subsequently seeks deliverability on either the host
system or an affected system and submits a transmission service request to either the host
transmission provider or the affected system transmission provider, the affected system
transmission provider will have the opportunity to study the request and potentially
require the construction of additional network upgrades on the affected system to
accommodate deliverability. Therefore, we find that being assigned significant affected
system network upgrades under an NRIS study without the obligation for the affected
system transmission provider to ensure that the output from an affected system
interconnection customer’s generating facility is integrated on the affected system similar
to generating facilities that serve the affected system transmission provider’s native load
customers or network resources results in unjust and unreasonable rates by increasing the
cost for affected system interconnection customers without a commensurate increase in
service.2429

Regarding claims that affected system transmission providers would need to
develop operating procedures or capital projects or perform curtailments due to the
additional stress on affected systems caused by affected system interconnection requests
being studied under the ERIS modeling standard,2430 we find these claims to be
speculative and that affected system studies are designed to ensure that an affected
system interconnection customer’s proposed generating facility can reliably connect to
the host system without adversely impacting an affected system and are not meant to
ensure deliverability on either the host or affected system. As mentioned above, an
affected system transmission provider has no obligation to ensure that an affected system
interconnection request is fully deliverable.
We are unpersuaded by arguments that the NOPR proposal may not work in all
scenarios2431 and note that commenters did not provide specific examples of how the
proposal would not work under the Commission’s pro forma LGIP process. Several
commenters raise concerns that, although the use of ERIS may work in regions with joint
operating agreements or coordinated transmission service studies, the use of ERIS for all
affected system studies may not be appropriate if an affected system transmission
provider’s transmission service studies do not identify all impacts. Once again, in
adopting the ERIS requirement for affected system transmission providers, we find that

ERIS is sufficient to capture reliability impacts of affected system interconnection
requests on the affected system. We do not address whether individual transmission
providers have adequate transmission service studies. If a transmission provider believes
that changes are needed to better consider the deliverability of transmission service on its
transmission system or with its neighboring transmission systems, nothing in this final
rule prevents transmission providers from addressing those concerns.
We decline requests for the Commission to set modeling standards, to require
transmission providers to include their modeling standards in their tariffs, or to provide
direction on how ERIS and NRIS should be studied and what service the interconnection
customer should receive, and to require neighboring transmission providers to coordinate
assumptions and update those assumptions quarterly.2432 We find these requests to be
outside the scope of the final rule.
Although some commenters request flexibility on whether to use ERIS or NRIS in
conducting an affected system study,2433 we find such a request is essentially a request to
maintain the status quo, which, as discussed above, results in Commission-jurisdictional
rates that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential and prevents

for the availability of an FPA section 205 filing in pro forma LGIP section 9.7 because
transmission providers always have the right to submit an FPA section 205 filing.

Optional Resource Solicitation Study
a.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission explained that resource solicitation processes
inspire a number of interconnection requests, but in most cases, state agencies and LSEs
implementing state mandates do not have the opportunity to request dedicated studies
themselves.2434
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to require transmission
providers to allow resource planning entities, i.e., any entity required to develop a
resource plan or conduct a resource solicitation process, including a state entity or LSE,
to initiate an optional resource solicitation study.2435
Under the NOPR proposal, the resource planning entity would identify the valid
interconnection requests associated with its qualifying resource solicitation process or

qualifying resource plan and request that the transmission provider study several
combinations of those interconnection requests in a resource solicitation study.2436
The Commission clarified that under this proposal, the resource planning entity
would not receive a queue position: interconnection customers would maintain their
queue position obtained through the cluster request window and proceed through the
regular interconnection queue alongside all other customers.2437
The Commission proposed that the transmission provider must evaluate each
combination of interconnection requests submitted by the resource planning entity as a
group, in the same manner it will perform cluster studies under the proposed pro forma
LGIP.2438 The Commission proposed a 135-calendar day time limit on the optional
resource solicitation study (compared to 150 calendar days for the cluster study).
The Commission sought comment on: (1) the NOPR proposal to explicitly
include state agencies that are required to develop a resource plan or conduct a resource
solicitation process in the definition of a resource planning entity; (2) whether other
entities should qualify as resource planning entities and therefore be able to request
initiation of an optional resource solicitation study, and, if so, what impact, if any, their
inclusion would have on the efficiency of the interconnection process and whether their
inclusion would raise concerns of undue discrimination or preference; (3) whether the

including whether the optional resource solicitation study report could be posted on the

Comments in Opposition

AES states that it does not believe reforms on this issue should be part of the final
rule but does not oppose transmission providers submitting optional resource solicitation
study proposals to the Commission pursuant to separate FPA section 205 filings after
consultation with stakeholders.2443
AEP disagrees with the Commission’s conclusion that failure to provide for a
resource solicitation process leads to unjust and unreasonable rates.2444 AEP argues that
this reasoning only applies to “entities required to conduct a resource plan or resource
solicitation process” and that, accordingly, there is no legal basis to “solve” the problem
through a nationwide mandate, as transmission providers with no LSEs that are required
to “conduct a resource plan or resource solicitation process” do not need to amend their
tariffs to include the optional resource solicitation study proposal. AEP asserts that there
is no evidence that LSEs in RTOs/ISOs need the optional resource solicitation study
process to perform IRPs efficiently and reach appropriate procurement decisions. AECI
argues that resource planning entities should maintain discretion over their portfolios, and
that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to mandate deployment of any particular resource

or to require transmission providers to provide preferential treatment towards any specific
technology.2445
Several commenters argue that the proposed optional resource solicitation study is
unnecessary, particularly in regions such as PJM and MISO, which have existing or
proposed processes for considering state objectives.2446
CAISO and SPP argue that the proposed optional resource solicitation study may
create uncertainty regarding the cost and timing of interconnecting to the transmission
system.2447 CAISO asserts that it is impossible to provide meaningful cost data to
interconnection customers until the transmission provider knows precisely the entire
make-up of the study cluster.2448
Several commenters question the efficacy of the resource solicitation study
proposal.2449 PJM argues that, because the study would include only a subset of the
clustered interconnection requests, the results would not be indicative of the outcome
when considering the entire cluster, and would not provide information upon which

argue that the studies would not be expected to yield a reliable estimate of the total costs
of the portfolio of resources being contemplated by the resource planner.2451 Similarly,
Indicated PJM TOs argue that optional studies will divert scarce resources away from
curing the fundamental problem, arguing that such studies may not be valuable to
resource planners because they would be conducted in a vacuum, would not account for
other interconnection requests, and would not necessarily lead to the most efficient
combination of resources.2452
Some commenters assert that prospective interconnection customers will have an
incentive to lodge speculative interconnection requests antithetical to the desired
streamlining of the pro forma LGIA and pro forma LGIP process contemplated by the
NOPR.2453 APPA-LPPC comment that, to the extent that the generating facilities
associated with interconnection requests are competing in a resource solicitation in which
they may not be selected, such interconnection requests could constitute the kind of
speculative interconnection request that the NOPR otherwise discourages.2454

time consuming and would require significant resources to complete.2456 Enel states that,
because a transmission provider would be required to evaluate six full cluster studies (i.e.,
one standard plus five sensitivities) with different combinations of generating facilities,
the optional resource solicitation study would inevitably lead to delays, restudies, latestage withdrawals, errors, and increased potential for inadequate consideration of lower
cost and alternative mitigations.2457 The Colorado Commission argues that the NOPR

interconnection scarcity concerns if it required the elimination of resource solicitation
clusters as currently implemented by the Colorado utilities.2458
Some commenters question whether transmission providers can realistically
manage interconnection cluster studies and perhaps multiple optional resource
solicitation studies at the same time.2459 Indicated PJM TOs state that the ability for any
resource planning entity to initiate the resource solicitation study without warning at any
time would be especially burdensome.2460 MISO warns that multiple resource planning
entities could request an optional study with different combinations, requiring MISO to
perform numerous iterations of its system impact studies.2461 Several commenters argue
that instituting an additional study will put further strain on transmission providers’
limited staff resources.2462 Bonneville, WAPA, and NRECA assert that most small
transmission providers are not staffed or organized to accomplish the work discussed by
the Commission.2463

Several commenters caution the Commission that the optional resource solicitation
studies could be costly.2464 MISO contends that mandating a new study activity without a
corresponding study deposit may result in a situation where study deposit funds run out,
halting interconnection studies until more funds are provided and leading to
interconnection queue delays.2465 NRECA also argues that requiring both the optional
informational interconnection studies and the optional resource solicitation studies
increase costs for transmission customers.2466 SEIA argues that imposing an optional
resource solicitation process in the early stages of the interconnection process, before
interconnection customers receive the cost estimates of their network upgrades, means
that the results from the study may not accurately reflect the costs of the network
upgrades for the resources in the study.2467 Enel argues that, because the resource
planning entity selects generating facilities for scenarios without any knowledge of
interconnection results, it is possible that the selected generating facilities will end up
being built despite large upgrade costs.2468

Several commenters contend that the proposal is unjust, unreasonable, and unduly
discriminatory or preferential because it gives special treatment to generating facilities
selected to fulfill a resource plan without full consideration of interconnection
upgrades.2469 Several commenters are concerned that this proposal could allow vertically
integrated transmission providers or LSEs to use the process in a way that would
inappropriately favor the interconnection of company-owned resources.2470 NARUC and
SEIA explain that an LSE could have a transmission provider identify cost-saving
interconnection options through the optional resource solicitation study for companyowned resources but exclude non-company-owned resources from the analysis, thus
tipping the cost evaluation in favor of the company’s resources.2471 Likewise, Interwest
and EPSA are concerned that priority in interconnection queue processing for
interconnection requests selected in a resource plan and under contract with a utility may
provide competitive advantages for vertically integrated utilities because of their control

over the selection of projects and the identification and timing of the installation of
network upgrades.2472
SEIA also argues that an optional resource solicitation study in situations where
there is a commercial readiness requirement presents numerous opportunities for a utility
to discriminate against independent power producers in favor of that utility’s own
generation.2473 AEP argues that, in multi-state RTOs/ISOs, the proposal facially
discriminates against LSEs that are not eligible resource planning entities or are located
in states that are not eligible resource planning entities themselves, and shifts key
RTO/ISO resources away from such entities.2474 In RTOs/ISOs that allow bilateral
capacity procurement, AEP argues that the proposal likewise discriminates between LSEs
with qualifying resource planning entities (which may well be themselves) and those
without.
Multiple commenters argue that the proposed requirement to perform an optional
resource solicitation study in multiple states imposes a considerable burden on
RTOs/ISOs without providing meaningful benefits.2475 PJM argues that requiring it “to

expedite and process the country’s largest interconnection queue would require PJM to
take on a role beyond its authority as a transmission provider.2476 Similarly, Indicated
PJM TOs argue that there is no justification for requiring transmission providers to
provide resource solicitation studies when consultants could do so.2477
The North Dakota Commission suggests that the Commission should consider
whether the proposal potentially allows cost-shifting from states or localities with
significant resource build out mandates to other states within the RTO/ISO and how to
mitigate such unjust cost-shifting.2478 Similarly, Interwest cautions that, in bilateral and
RTO/ISO markets, requiring a ranking in priority between interconnection requests may
result in setting up competition between the utilities, with each vying for space on the
constrained system.2479
Tri-State adds that there are “timing issues” regarding the optional resource
solicitation study, as it does not align with the electric resource planning process within
Colorado, and potentially other states.2480 The Colorado Commission is also concerned

Requests for Alternatives and Regional Flexibility

Public Interest Organizations argue that the Commission should grant extra
flexibility on the 135-calendar day study timeline.2482 Several commenters support the
implementation of boundaries or guardrails to ensure that optional resource solicitation
studies do not delay the study of other interconnection requests by diverting needed
resources away from the general interconnection queue.2483 Several commenters support
the proposal so long as protections are included to prevent undue discrimination and
maintain a competitive generation solicitation.2484
NARUC asks the Commission to consider going farther than requiring the
optional resource solicitation study only for purposes of transparency and cost estimation;
it recommends making the results of the studies available for interconnection customers

on an expedited basis.2485
Xcel, the Colorado Commission, and EEI argue that the resource solicitation
cluster should have its own queue position.2486 Enel recommends that the optional
resource solicitation study be a separate queue cycle with an intermediate queue priority
between the transmission provider’s annual study clusters.2487 Several commenters argue
that resources selected as part of the resource solicitation process should be given priority
in the interconnection queue.2488 The Colorado Commission suggests that the
Commission modify its proposal to prioritize interconnection requests selected to serve
native and network load within the RTO/ISO.
The Colorado Commission and Xcel encourage the Commission to determine that
any current resource solicitation cluster processes already in place remain just and
reasonable or are consistent with/superior to the final rule.2489 SEIA disagrees, noting

Colorado Commission’s current proposal to prioritize interconnection requests selected in
the state process conflicts with this 2004 order and the Commission’s “longstanding
prohibition against queue jumping.”2491
Multiple commenters request clarification and changes to the NOPR’s proposal on
resource solicitation in multistate transmission areas,2492 but NARUC and Xcel suggest
that facilitated coordination of resource planning and interconnection as well as
discussion across states and LSEs may be the most helpful practice to reduce the burden
of differing state portfolio requirements on transmission providers in multi-state areas.2493
Several commenters suggest that the proposed optional resource solicitation study
should occur outside the tariff process.2494 NextEra argues that the absence of such a

solicitation study.2500 We find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to justify
establishing the optional resource solicitation study process proposed in the NOPR as a
generic solution across all regions for coordinating state-level resource planning with the
interconnection process. As commenters explain, many transmission providers do not
have LSEs that conduct a resource solicitation process. We are also concerned that the
particular “one size fits all” approach proposed in the NOPR would create uncertainty
regarding the cost and timing of interconnecting to the transmission system, because the
proposed study would not result in useful network upgrade cost estimates. Finally, we
agree with commenters that the proposal as set forth in the NOPR would divert
transmission provider resources and potentially lead to delays in the processing of the
interconnection queue.
Notwithstanding our decision not to adopt the NOPR’s resource solicitation
proposal, we agree with commenters who note that, in certain regions, resource
solicitation studies have the potential to reduce uncertainty, improve coordination, and
make resource planning more efficient and cost effective. We acknowledge comments
arguing that a resource solicitation study may be most effective if paired with a structure
where the resources within the resource solicitation structure are granted their own queue
position, as this provides the relevant resources and soliciting entity with actionable
information and avoids the uncertainty and delay that may occur if a study is conducted

2500

Because we are not adopting this proposal, we do not address comments on
specific aspects of the proposal.

only for informational purposes and the associated resources do not have a queue position
that corresponds to the study assumptions.2501 We note that our decision not to adopt the
NOPR’s proposal in this final rule in no way prejudges any future resource solicitation
study proposals that transmission providers may choose to file pursuant to FPA section
205.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission noted that the current pro forma LGIP does not
address interconnection requests made up of multiple generating facilities seeking to colocate and to share a single point of interconnection.2502 The Commission preliminarily
found that the lack of such a process limits the interconnection of generating facilities,
hindering competition and rendering the Commission’s existing pro forma LGIP unjust,
unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential.2503

The Commission therefore proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP and pro forma
LGIA to “require transmission providers to allow more than one generating facility to colocate on a shared site behind a single point of interconnection and share a single
interconnection request.”2504 The Commission explained that this proposed reform would
“create a minimum standard that would remove barriers for co-located resources by
creating a standardized procedure for these types of configurations to enable them to
access the transmission system.”2505
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to: “(1) define ‘CoLocated Resources’ as ‘more than one resource located behind the same point of
interconnection’; (2) state that co-located resources can share an interconnection request;
(3) modify the definition of site control such that it allows interconnection customers to
demonstrate shared land-use for co-located resources.”2506 The Commission also
proposed to modify the definition of interconnection facilities to clarify that multiple
generating facilities located on the same site may share interconnection facilities.2507
The Commission also proposed revisions to the pro forma LGIP to “require
generating facilities that are co-locating to have technology to address differences in
terminal voltage between the co-located generating facilities to ensure that these

generating facilities have the same voltage levels.”2508 The Commission noted that many
co-located generating facilities are co-located with electric storage resources,2509 and
proposed to define “electric storage resources” in the pro forma LGIP as a resource
capable of receiving electric energy from the grid and storing it for later injection of
electric energy back to the grid.2510

providing incremental efficiency to transmission providers.2513
Evergreen Action avers that co-location is vital to connecting more generation in
the short term as transmission providers begin to work through large interconnection
queue backlogs,2514 and Evergreen Action and NRECA state that co-locating two or more
resources will take advantage of technologies like battery storage to more efficiently use
the transmission system.2515 AEE and State Agencies argue that, because existing
interconnection procedures were designed before battery storage and hybrid resource
types came into common usage, these types of technologies are often underserved under
existing interconnection procedures despite being well represented in current
interconnection queues, making this reform timely.2516 OSPA urges the Commission to
implement this proposal as soon as possible.2517
Several commenters argue that the NOPR proposal will likely improve the overall

argues that combinations of generation and storage on a single site will create several
benefits, including reducing intermittency, shifting supply to better meet demand,
responding to grid events, and enabling provision of ancillary services.2519
AEE argues that the greatest value of storage systems is their ability to respond
rapidly with a high degree of controllability, and contends that hybrid resources smooth
the output of variable resources, allowing for increased land use efficiencies.2520 Several
commenters argue that the proposal will yield interconnection queue efficiency because
the shared nature of the co-located resources can be fully accounted for in a single
interconnection request: they contend that requiring co-located resources to submit
multiple interconnection requests increases cost, timing, and complexity, while forgoing
reliability benefits.2521
In support of the proposal, AEE argues that several transmission providers already
allow co-located generating facilities at the same point of interconnection to submit a
single request (e.g., CAISO, ISO-NE, and MISO).2522 AES contends that the

Commission’s proposed reforms are necessary to ensure parity across all RTOs/ISOs on
this issue, as some RTOs’/ISOs’ practices erect unnecessary and unreasonable barriers
for generating facilities located behind a single point of interconnection to
interconnect.2523
Omaha Public Power supports the Commission’s proposals to facilitate new
technologies, specifically the reforms related to co-located resources, revisions to the
modification process, and surplus interconnection capacity.2524 Omaha Public Power
observes, however, that many transmission providers have already made progress in this
area and therefore recommends that the Commission allow existing transmission provider
processes that are facilitating new technologies to continue.

Comments on Specific Proposal

Avangrid asserts that the Commission’s proposal should not change or supersede
any regional metering requirements for market participation and contends that co-located
resources must have separate meters even if they share a point of interconnection.2525

facilities must have technology to address differences in terminal voltage between the colocated generating facilities.2526 MISO states that having to study a single co-located

generating facility with two points of interconnection at different voltages would be
infeasible, and that co-located generating facilities should be required to inject at a single
point of interconnection, at a single voltage.2527 SPP states that it is unclear what the
Commission intended in the NOPR by proposing to require that generating facilities
“address differences in terminal voltage between the co-located generating facilities to
ensure that these generating facilities have the same voltage levels.”2528 SPP contends
that it would be simpler to require that such generating facilities connect at the same
point of interconnection and leave the details as to how to do that to the interconnection
customer. Ameren argues that, so long as modeling is available to the transmission
provider for the types of resources that are behind the point of interconnection, co-located
resources with differences in terminal voltage should not be an issue when performing
the interconnection studies.2529
Ørsted supports the Commission’s proposed changes to the definition of
“interconnection facilities.”2530 Enel states that the proposed insertion of the phrase “by

customer(s).”2531 Enel further states that the proposed new fourth sentence to the
definition of “interconnection facilities” explains that multiple interconnection customers
may use a single set of interconnection facilities, and thus “sole use facilities” may have
multiple interconnection customer beneficiaries.
Southern states that, under the NOPR proposal, co-located resources can include
different owners of different generating facilities.2532 Pine Gate and Southern note that
the proposal to allow interconnection customers to demonstrate shared land-use may
require interconnection customers to provide transmission providers more detailed site
maps to demonstrate valid site control for each generating facility.2533 Southern states
that this is appropriate because the transmission provider should not be responsible for
monitoring the legal relationship between the co-owners.2534 Southern states that colocated resources must either be owned by the same owner, or the different owners of the
generating facilities must enter into an agreement that addresses off-take rights and
ownership, and they must submit one interconnection request for the entire generating
facility. Tri-State suggests clarifying that a separate agreement is not necessary when
both co-located resources belong to the same interconnection customer.2535

Clean Energy Associations support allowing multiple generating facilities that
share a single point of interconnection to submit a joint interconnection request as a
hybrid or co-located resource. Clean Energy Associations argue that interconnection
customers with proposed generating facilities where the electric storage resource and
generating facility are co-located, and have two “resource IDs,” should be allowed to
choose to have each component studied separately.2536 Clean Energy Associations also
submit that the generating equipment for the generating facilities should not be required
to be located on a shared site. Clean Energy Associations further assert that such
flexibility would allow, for example, a solar facility to obtain a faster ERIS study while
the co-located storage could get a more detailed study for NRIS.
Southern contends that co-located resources that intend to be qualifying facilities
should be required to comply with PURPA requirements.2537

Requests for Clarification and Flexibility

Pine Gate agrees that co-located generating facilities must have technology to
address differences in terminal voltage between the co-located generating facilities,
arguing that such technology is likely necessary in instances where a co-located resource
is being studied under a single interconnection request for a net injection at the point of
interconnection.2538 However, Pine Gate requests that the Commission clarify that such

technology is not necessary in instances in which the interconnection customer elects to
submit a co-located resource using two separate interconnection requests.
SPP notes that in the NOPR, the Commission proposed to define “co-located
resources” as “more than one resource located behind the same point of interconnection,”
whereas the proposed definition in the pro forma LGIP reads, “Co-Located Resource
shall mean multiple Generating Facilities located on the same site.”2539 SPP states that
two generating facilities can be located on the same site without connecting behind the
same point of interconnection. SPP asks the Commission to clarify in the final rule
which definition of co-located resource is required. SPP states that it supports a
definition that explicitly states that the generating facilities must connect at the same
point of interconnection.
MISO and Southern request that the Commission clarify that co-located resources
must be required to share an interconnection request.2540 According to MISO, its tariff
and Order No. 8072541 allow for different interconnection requests to share a generator tie
line and thus share the same point of interconnection. MISO argues that failing to amend
the definition of co-located resource would conflate the two scenarios under the same
definition, such that two separate noncontiguous generating facilities that share a

the definition of co-located resources without the intent to do so.2542 Southern argues that
the Commission should clarify that the interconnection tie line connecting the co-located
resource to the transmission system is a radial facility, not a network facility.2543
National Grid asks that the Commission clarify what is included in the definition
of “co-located resources.”2544 National Grid understands that the term can apply to
hybrid technologies owned by a single interconnection customer interconnecting to a
single point of interconnection, such as a solar generating facility coupled with a storage
facility. National Grid suggests that, to the extent the term also is intended to apply to
multiple interconnection customers with separate generating facilities interconnecting to
a single point of interconnection, that the proposal might create complexities not
discussed in the NOPR but may merit consideration.
SEIA requests clarification on the terminology used in the proposal.2545 SEIA
states that in January 2021, in its order directing reports on information related to hybrid
resources, the Commission used two distinct terms to identify hybrid resource market
participation.2546 SEIA states that “co-located hybrid resources” are defined as two

separate resources sharing a single point of interconnection that are modeled and
dispatched separately. SEIA states that “integrated hybrid resources” are defined as sets
of resources that share a single point of interconnection and are modeled and dispatched
as a single resource. Tri-State similarly states that the “electric storage resource”
definition does not account for resources designed to be charged apart from the
transmission system, such as solar or wind generating facilities that may charge an
electric storage resource.2547 SEIA requests that the Commission adopt the terms colocated and integrated hybrid resources in the final rule and clarify that interconnection
customers retain the choice of how to structure their interconnection requests to best suit
their needs and the needs of their customers.2548
Some commenters ask that the Commission provide regional flexibility as to the
types of co-located resources permitted in each RTO/ISO and existing processes that may
already accomplish the goals of the proposed reforms.2549 ISO-NE, NYISO, and MISO

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modification, the NOPR proposal to revise pro forma LGIP
section 3.1.2 to require transmission providers to allow more than one generating facility
to co-locate on a shared site behind a single point of interconnection and share a single
interconnection request. We decline to adopt the proposed definitions of “co-located
resource” and “electric storage resource,” and we decline to adopt the proposed
modifications to the definitions of interconnection facilities, and transmission provider’s
interconnection facilities in pro forma LGIP section 1 and pro forma LGIA article 1.2551
We find that including the definition of co-located resource in the pro forma LGIP and
pro forma LGIA is not necessary to effectuate the process reforms detailed in the NOPR,
and thus decline to adopt it here.2552 Given that Order No. 845 revised the definition of
generating facility to include electric storage resources,2553 we also find it unnecessary to
define the term electric storage resource in the pro forma LGIP and LGIA. We note that
declining to adopt the definition of electric storage resource moots Tri-State’s concern

2551

NOPR, 179 FERC ¶ 61,194 at P 243; proposed pro forma LGIA section 1.

Co-located generating facilities are more than one generating facility that are
located on the same site and that are connected at the same point of interconnection that
are operated and dispatched as separate generating facilities.
2553

See Order No. 845, 163 FERC ¶ 61,043, at P 275 (modifying the definition of
“Generating Facility” in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA to include “and/or
storage for later injection”).

that the proposed definition failed to account for electric storage resources that may be
charged apart from the transmission system.2554
We also decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to modify the definitions of
interconnection facilities and transmission provider’s interconnection facilities to specify
that interconnection facilities may be shared among interconnection customers. We find
that such specification in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA is not needed because
Commission policy does not prohibit interconnection customers from sharing
interconnection facilities.2555 We expect that there may be benefits from interconnection
customers being able to share transmission provider’s interconnection facilities and
interconnection customer’s interconnection facilities, particularly in light of the
Commission’s transition in this final rule to a cluster study approach. Under a cluster
study approach, in which multiple interconnection requests are evaluated in a combined
study, efficiencies may be gained (in cost and time to construct) by allowing
interconnection customers to share use of, and payment for, interconnection facilities.
We note that such efficiencies from allowing the interconnection facilities to be used by
more than one interconnection customer do not exist under the Commission’s existing
pro forma LGIP serial interconnection study process because the serial study process
does not consider the interconnection facilities that would be necessary to accommodate

the interconnection of more than one interconnection customer. In response to Ørsted
and Enel’s comments expressing support for the revisions to the definitions of
interconnection facilities and transmission provider’s interconnection facilities,2556 we
state in this final rule that the interconnection facilities also may be used by more than
one interconnection customer.
We also decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to revise the pro forma LGIP to
require generating facilities that are co-locating to have technology to address differences
in terminal voltage between the co-located generating facilities to ensure that these
generating facilities have the same voltage levels.2557 We find that the preexisting
language in pro forma LGIP section 3.1 (section 3.1.2 as revised by this final rule) is
clear that “[a]n Interconnection Request to evaluate one site at two different voltage
levels shall be treated as two Interconnection Requests.” This preexisting provision
makes clear that a set of co-located generating facilities must be at a single terminal
voltage in order to be treated as a single interconnection request. The additional
requirement proposed in the NOPR is therefore unnecessary to adopt in the final rule.
We note that declining to adopt the NOPR proposal with respect to this issue alleviates
SPP’s concern with the NOPR proposal.2558 In response to Pine Gate, we reiterate that
preexisting pro forma LGIP section 3.1 (section 3.1.2 as revised by this final rule) would

require co-located generating facilities with different terminal voltage levels to submit
separate interconnection requests.2559
As the Commission stated in the NOPR, recent studies demonstrate that large
numbers of generating facilities currently in interconnection queues are seeking to colocate on a shared site behind one point of interconnection and share an interconnection
request, while operating separately, and that the pro forma LGIP currently lacks
provisions that explicitly allow them to do so.2560 We agree with commenters that this
type of generating facility configuration, in spite of being prevalent in current
interconnection queues, faces barriers to interconnection under existing interconnection
procedures,2561 and that this reform will effectively remove such barriers. We find that
requiring transmission providers to allow interconnection customers to submit a single
interconnection request that represents multiple generating facilities that are located
behind a single point of interconnection is required to ensure just and reasonable rates.
By doing so, this reform will improve efficiency for transmission providers in the study
process by reducing the number of interconnection requests in the interconnection queue
and will reduce costs for interconnection customers because they will only submit a
single set of deposits to enter the interconnection queue.

We also believe that this reform will improve interconnection queue efficiency
without imposing an adverse impact on the efficacy of interconnection study results or
other interconnection customers. Because of the significant growth of generating
facilities seeking to interconnect jointly at a single point of interconnection,2562 we find
that allowing co-located generating facilities to submit one interconnection request will
lessen the delays experienced in many interconnection queues. We agree with
commenters that transmission providers requiring co-located generating facilities to
submit separate interconnection requests increases the cost and complexity of the
interconnection process and creates undue delay to the interconnection process.2563
Allowing co-located generating facilities to share interconnection requests will ensure the
interconnection queue moves along expediently, providing clarity, cost certainty, and
increased transparency throughout the study process.
Some commenters suggest that co-located generating facilities should always be
required to share an interconnection request.2564 Others request that interconnection
customers retain the choice whether to share an interconnection request.2565 We clarify

that interconnection customers have the choice to structure their interconnection requests
according to their preference. We are not requiring interconnection customers to share a
single interconnection request for multiple generating facilities located on the same site.
However, we further clarify in response to Clean Energy Associations2566 that
interconnection customers may submit separate interconnection requests to have each
device studied separately. We find that this clarification also addresses MISO’s concern
about any potential conflict with Order No. 807.2567 Additionally, we clarify that, where
an interconnection customer chooses to submit a single interconnection request for
multiple generating facilities, the generating facilities must be located on the same site in
order to reduce complexity for the transmission provider.
In response to Southern’s request that the Commission clarify that the
interconnection tie line connecting the co-located resource to the transmission system is a
radial facility, not a network facility, we clarify that, as explained in Order No. 807, the
Commission now refers to tie lines as the interconnection customer’s interconnection
facilities.2568 As the Commission stated in Order No. 807, the interconnection customer’s

interconnection facilities “are sole-use, limited and discrete, radial in nature, and not part
of an integrated transmission network.”2569 Radial facilities located between the
generating facility and point of interconnection are considered interconnection facilities
under the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA.2570
In response to Omaha Public Power’s suggestion that the Commission allow
existing transmission provider processes that are facilitating new technologies to continue
unimpeded, we clarify that, consistent with Section IV of this final rule, to the extent
transmission providers believe that they already comply with the adopted pro forma
LGIP provisions, they may demonstrate this in their compliance filings.
In response to concerns about multiple interconnection customers using the same
interconnection request,2571 we clarify that co-located generating facilities can be owned
by a single interconnection customer with multiple generating facilities sharing a site, or
by multiple interconnection customers that have a contract or other agreement that allows

for shared land use.2572 In response to Tri-State,2573 we clarify that no such agreement is
necessary when the generating facilities in question belong to the same interconnection
customer. In response to Southern,2574 we clarify that generating facilities that co-locate
still must adhere to all other applicable laws and regulations, including PURPA.
We find that comments regarding the following issues are outside the scope of this
proceeding because they pertain to market issues and other rules that were not addressed
in the NOPR: (1) permitting an interconnection customer to specify the co-located
generating facility’s maximum injection level to the point of interconnection;2575 and (2)
metering requirements for co-located generating facilities.2576
We decline SEIA’s request that the Commission adopt a more expansive
definition of “co-located resources,” including how the resources are modeled and
dispatched. Modeling assumptions for electric storage resources and co-located or hybrid
generating facilities containing electric storage resources are addressed elsewhere in this
final rule.2577

The revised definition of site control in the pro forma LGIP adopted in this
final rule requires that site control be “demonstrated by a contract or other agreement that
allows for shared land use for all Generating Facilities that are co-located and meet the
provisions of the Site Control definition.” Pro forma LGIP section 3.4.2.

- 876 Revisions to the Modification Process to Require
Consideration of Generating Facility Additions
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission expressed concern that, because certain requests to
add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request are often deemed material
without an evaluation, even if the injection amount remains the same, the material
modification process may result in unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or
preferential outcomes.2578 The Commission pointed out that, as explained in Order No.
2003, it is inadequate and inefficient to solve interconnection issues on a case-by-case
basis.2579 The Commission explained that, in the case of processing modification
requests, without a standard set of procedures, transmission providers have adopted
varying strategies for processing requests to add electric storage or other generating
facilities that do not change the requested interconnection service limit to existing
interconnection requests. The Commission preliminarily found that this lack of
uniformity leads to disparate outcomes across the country and leaves open the potential
for undue discrimination.
The Commission explained that the modification provisions in the pro forma
LGIP do not specify whether an interconnection customer can modify its interconnection
request to add another generating facility at the same point of interconnection without

increasing the requested interconnection service level.2580 The Commission stated that
many transmission providers treat such a request automatically as a material
modification, such that the interconnection customer that wishes to make this type of
change faces a loss of interconnection queue position regardless of the actual effect the
addition of a generating facility to an interconnection request may have on the system.
The Commission explained that this process is a significant barrier to interconnection
customers that wish to make this type of change and preliminarily found that such a
barrier hinders access to the transmission system and may render existing interconnection
processes unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential.2581
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers to evaluate the proposed addition of a generating facility to an
interconnection request as long as the interconnection customer does not request a change
to the originally requested interconnection service level.2582 Under this proposed
requirement, the transmission provider could not automatically consider such a request to
be a material modification. Specifically, the Commission proposed to require that:
“(1) transmission providers evaluate the proposed addition of a generating facility to an
interconnection request within 60 calendar days of receiving the request for modification
if such addition does not change the requested interconnection service level; (2) the

change cannot be considered an automatic material modification and an evaluation
(including studying the configuration and necessary modeling) must occur prior to
determining whether the proposed change constitutes a material modification of the
interconnection request; and (3) if the proposed addition does not have a material impact
on the cost or timing of any interconnection request that is lower or equally queued, and
does not cause any other reliability concerns, the addition will not be considered a
material modification.”2583 The Commission noted that the reliability concerns could
include, for example, a material impact on the transmission system with regard to short
circuit capability limits, steady-state thermal and voltage limits, or dynamic system
stability and response.
The Commission sought comment on: “(1) whether the addition of a generating
facility that does not alter an interconnection customer’s interconnection service limit
could nonetheless require a full interconnection service study; (2) how transmission
providers should perform studies required to confirm that there is no adverse impact
because of the addition of a generating facility to an interconnection request, such as
confirmation that the electrical characteristics of the interconnection customer remain the
same; (3) whether and how interconnection customers in a later cluster, or
interconnection customers that are in the same cluster, could be adversely impacted by
such changes; (4) whether the addition of electric storage when in charging mode (in
terms of resistance, inductance, and capacitance) may change the electrical characteristics

generating facility that does not increase the requested service level or cause reliability
issues, but rather could improve the performance and capability of a generating facility to
manage reliability or lower the cost of energy to customers, is an inefficient and
discriminatory outcome the Commission should seek to permanently remedy through this
proceeding. AEE and Public Interest Organizations assert that a restudy would be
automatically required for adding a generating facility such as storage, and that if there
were not a restudy related to the addition of storage, they could provide numerous
benefits, including firming up variable renewable generation, avoided curtailment,
congestion relief, and, in the case of grid-forming inverters and batteries, fast frequency
response and other grid flexibility services.2587 AEE contends that the loss of the
benefits, primarily from adding storage, will harm reliability and result in unjust and
unreasonable rates.2588 SEIA contends that adding an additional generating facility (such
as storage) that does not increase the interconnection service level also should not
increase the costs to later interconnection requests because it generally would not require
additional network upgrades and should not delay lower-queued interconnection

Clean Energy Associations and Shell add that a generating facility’s addition of
energy storage capability without increasing the power capability upon which its
interconnection service level is based (e.g., increasing a two-hour battery to a four-hour
battery) should not automatically be considered a material modification.2590 Clean
Energy Associations also argue that the removal of a generating facility from a hybrid or
co-located resource interconnection request should not automatically be considered a
material modification if interconnection service levels do not change.2591 Clean Energy
Associations also request that the material modification rules allow for an increase in the
underlying capability of the generating facility, rather than simply an addition of a new
resource.
Ameren believes that when considering the addition of a generating facility to an
interconnection request, it is important to protect reliability while avoiding unjustly
limiting interconnection customer changes by automatically deeming them material
modifications.2592 National Grid supports the proposal but asks the Commission to
acknowledge that there may be instances when a determination that the requested
generating facility addition is a material modification is necessary, such as if: (1)
changes in load characteristics of the generating facility or in electrical characteristics of

a resource; or (2) impacts to other interconnection customers in the interconnection
queue.2593 SPP also generally supports the proposal but similarly notes there may be
instances when a request that does not alter the interconnection service amount, it could
require a full interconnection study and result in additional network upgrades (e.g., a
request to change a generating facility from one type to another where changes to electric
characteristics impact stability, fault current, or both).2594
AES supports the proposal because it adds flexibility to the interconnection
process, including the efficient addition of generating facilities such as electric storage
resources to previously submitted interconnection requests.2595 UMPA supports the
flexibility of a generating facility’s design if a more commercially viable option could be
pursued without changing the level of interconnection service or causing reliability
concerns, in particular when a prospective interconnection customer intends to acquire a
preexisting interconnection queue position in accordance with pro forma LGIP section
4.3.2596
AEE suggests that the flexibility to adopt “modest modifications” is important due
to the current length of the interconnection process, technology changes, price declines,

and other factors such as supply chain challenges.2597 AEE recognizes that some
modifications may be material and will require restudy but suggests that disallowing
modest changes like adding energy storage that may be beneficial, will harm reliability,
and could increase consumer costs by limiting the ability to respond to changing
opportunities and needs. NRECA supports the reform if it results in better use of the
transmission system but argues that flexibility should not come at the expense of the
NOPR’s overall goal of reducing speculative interconnection requests, withdrawals, and
restudies.2598
Some commenters point out that certain RTOs/ISOs use similar approaches to
those proposed.2599 NARUC highlights that certain planning regions have demonstrated
that they can reliably accommodate generating facility additions that do not increase
requested services levels without treating the modification as a material change.2600
NARUC underscores CAISO’s flexible process that allows interconnection customers to
modify the interconnection request and treats fewer resource additions as a material
modification, which results in more consistent and predictable interconnection queue
outcomes and ultimately more optimized investments.

Comments in Opposition

A number of commenters oppose the proposal.2601 ISO-NE and Idaho Power
argue that the Commission should require that interconnection requests be fully
conceived by the time a cluster request window is closed and modifications be proposed
in a subsequent cluster so it does not delay the cluster.2602 ISO-NE contends that the
flexibility in the proposal is contrary to the NOPR’s goal of improving study completion
timelines and readiness requirements because adding a generating facility to an
interconnection request could introduce major changes to study scope, upgrade results,
and delay rather than increase study time speed.2603
MISO opposes the proposal because it believes that the proposal will increase
speculative interconnection requests, contrary to the stated intention of NOPR, and that
the balance is disrupted between flexibility to make changes and promoting fairness and
certainty to other interconnection customers.2604 PJM, MISO, and Indicated PJM TOs
argue that the proposal will cause delays and divert resources that would have been used

toward processing the interconnection queue,2605 and MISO states the proposal may
enable an end-run around its site control deadlines by giving interconnection customers
more time to obtain site control.2606
MISO states that, each time an interconnection customer requests a fuel change
(including the addition of storage), under the proposal, MISO would have to determine if
a material modification exists within 60 days by doing the following: (1) stop processing
the interconnection queue, create an alternative model, and then run two system impact
studies based on the different models (original and alternate) to determine if there were
any changes between the two studies; (2) rebuild the models of any lower-queued cycles
and run alternate system impact studies to determine if that would create any impacts for
those interconnection requests, which MISO would not be able to complete within 60
days; and (3) correct the data that had been sent to an affected system operator, noting it
is unclear if the affected system operator would be able to inform MISO if the change in
data created a material modification.2607 MISO notes that it uses fuel-based dispatch in
its interconnection modeling, which exacerbates the above problems because it models
individual fuel types in different ways, and includes electric storage in its definition of a

different fuel type, so the addition of electric storage would result in a different type of
modeling.2608
PJM argues that interconnection customers should only be able to modify their
interconnection requests in certain circumstances, pointing to its proposal to allow
interconnection customers to make changes that meet pre-defined conditions at three
decision points, with the changes at each decision point restudied together.2609 PJM
claims that even if the maximum generating facility output or capacity interconnection
rights do not increase, adding a generating facility to an interconnection request can
affect other interconnection customers. PJM and Avangrid assert that substituting battery
storage facilities for a portion of a solar generating facility or other generating facility
without changing the generating facility’s maximum output or capacity interconnection
rights would likely be a material modification because it would require a light load test or
other testing that was not performed for the original solar generating facility
interconnection request.2610 Ameren also states that such interconnection request changes
can present challenges (e.g., when an interconnection customer’s chosen technology
changes due to the passage of time) and can raise reliability issues if not properly
addressed, and therefore it is necessary to evaluate or conduct a restudy to make sure that

the studies reflect the technologies actually being interconnected.2611 PacifiCorp
similarly argues that requests to incorporate grid-charging battery storage technology
should be processed separately because grid-charging capabilities can alter the electrical
characteristics of an interconnection request.2612 NV Energy states that in these situations
more detailed studies may be required in areas of the transmission system where the fault
duty is already high.2613
Southern argues that the proposal should not accept modifications to interconnection
requests without review because these requests could affect other interconnection
customers in the same cluster as well as lower-queued clusters, adding that it may be a
material modification that impacts the cost or timing of other interconnection requests.2614
MISO asserts that it is unclear if the NOPR proposal will require the
interconnection customer to submit evidence of site control before making the
modification request or after the request is granted.2615 Idaho Power notes that site
control requirements (primarily acreage) are based on the technology type used in the
interconnection request and would require modification if the technology is changed.2616

Idaho Power therefore argues that changing fuel type enables speculative interconnection
requests that can affect other interconnection customers both in later clusters and in the
same cluster.
Indicated PJM TOs also contend that not treating fuel type changes as material
modifications would provide gaming opportunities, e.g., an interconnection customer
could bypass the site control demonstration required at the outset of the study process by
entering the interconnection queue with a proposed storage project with a small site
footprint and later, without changing the size of the interconnection, adding a solar farm
with a much larger site footprint.2617 MISO also notes that the NOPR proposal is
contrary to a recent Commission-approved MISO tariff revision regarding changing fuel
types while it the interconnection queue, that went through a lengthy stakeholder
process.2618 MISO states that it uses fuel-based dispatch assumptions for interconnection
modeling and argues that there is not a simple process to determine if changing fuel
during the middle of the interconnection process could cause harm to lower- or equally
queued interconnection requests without running a new study based on the updated
model. MISO explains that it studies storage generating facilities differently than
renewable generating facilities, and this affects the interconnection modeling.2619

Indicated PJM TOs argue that determining the “materiality” of a particular type of
generating facility modification needs to take into account the cumulative impact on the
cluster studies of all similar requests.2620 Indicated PJM TOs explain that, even if a type
of modification sought by a single interconnection customer may have modest system
impacts and thus not be “material” in a particular case, the cumulative impact of multiple
similar requests in the same area could be much larger.
Indicated PJM TOs contend, however, that certain modifications made behind the
point of interconnection have reliability impacts requiring restudy and thus amount to
material modifications (e.g., changing fuel type by adding storage to a generating
facility).2621 Indicated PJM TOs contend that such changes will likely affect short circuit
capability limits, steady-state thermal and voltage limits, or dynamic system stability and
response.2622 Indicated PJM TOs also ask that the Commission recognize that different
fuel types among resources have very different seasonal characteristics and dynamic
response, arguing that the overall reliability of the transmission system could suffer if
certain types of changes are incorrectly identified as non-material.2623 However, Shell

contends that studies of the addition of a generating facility to an interconnection request
should be limited to determining increased costs and/or study or construction delays of
equal or lower-queued interconnection requests.2624
Indicated PJM TOs ask that, at a minimum, the Commission allow transmission
providers to determine the scope of “material modifications” based on their practical
experience on their own systems and apply that knowledge as to the types of changes that
typically affect other customers and that trigger the need for restudies.2625 Tri-State
asserts that, when the performance of a new proposed generating facility differs from the
existing/incumbent generating facility, transient stability analysis would be required but
steady state analysis (thermal/voltage) would not be required.2626
NERC argues that transmission providers should study the potential impacts of
any material change to the generating facility, such as the addition of storage, even when
the interconnection service level does not change, because material modifications to the
generating facility could alter stability and the interaction of a resource with the
transmission system (e.g., adding inverters, which can increase short circuit current, and
charging batteries from the transmission system, which can impact system power
flow).2627

Eversource argues that transmission providers cannot be expected to meet strict

Comments Seeking Materiality
Guidelines

Public Interest Organizations assert that the lack of a standardized definition in the
pro forma LGIP of what constitutes a material modification, such as the addition of
storage, leads to a lack of uniformity among transmission providers and disparate
outcomes that could result in undue discrimination.2629 Similarly, Environmental
Defense Fund asks the Commission to clarify how much flexibility transmission
providers will be permitted in determining whether adding co-located generating facilities
changes the service level and becomes a material modification, and it suggests that the
Commission adopt firm guidelines for transmission providers to determine when the

addition of a generating facility changes the service level to prevent discrimination
against generating facilities based on their inclusion of hybrid resources.2630
Pine Gate asks the Commission to require transmission providers to publish
additional, consistent criteria regarding what changes to an interconnection request will
and will not be deemed a material modification, and that transmission providers publish
their determinations about previous modification requests.2631 Pine Gate contends that
this information, which certain RTOs/ISOs already provide to interconnection customers,
will reduce the number of restudies, shorten overall interconnection queue processing
timelines, and reduce costs. Pine Gate, SEIA, and Shell support establishing thresholds,
arguing that providing guidance of what constitutes a material modification will provide
certainty to both interconnection customers and transmission owners.2632
OPSI asks the Commission to require transmission providers to publish guidance
on technologies and generating facility designs that would qualify presumptively as
minor system modifications.2633 Indicated PJM TOs ask for “bright line” criteria (based
on technical standards) for material modification to the extent possible, to narrow the
scope of changes in a service request that need to be evaluated.2634 However, Indicated

PJM TOs also argue that, in regions with large interconnection queues, the Commission
should give transmission providers the flexibility to define “material modification,”
taking into account the cumulative impact of particular categories of requested
modifications based on the transmission provider’s past experience regarding the
expected number of such requests.2635
APS supports the proposal but requests guidelines regarding different technology
types (e.g., increasing the size of a battery while also decreasing the size of a solar
generating facility to keep the interconnection amount the same).2636 APS recommends
that each technology type be treated independently in relation to requests to increase or
decrease the sizes in the original interconnection request or otherwise be deemed a
material modification (e.g., if the characteristics of a storage component change, it should
be considered a different request that may be a material modification).
R Street similarly asks the Commission to consider standardized, nondiscriminatory conditions that trigger a material change to an interconnection request,
even if the service limit does not change, arguing that hybrid resources should not be
penalized for their technology profile.2637 R Street notes, for example, that adding an
inverter-based generating facility to another such facility may not constitute a material

change, but adding a natural gas turbine to a solar site, even with no increase to net
output across the interconnection point, could create a material shift in interconnection
facilities.
NARUC asks the Commission to clarify the degree of flexibility transmission
providers have in determining what constitutes a material reliability concern on the
transmission system.2638 Cypress Creek asks the Commission to further modify the
current material modification definition to state that certain equipment changes are not
material (e.g., changing solar modules, changing inverter models, adding storage
capacity, or making minor adjustments to inverter performance) if planned export and
import capacity remains the same and the technology changes comport with
interconnection agreement requirements.2639 ClearPath asks: (1) whether under the
proposed definition a change in equipment that necessitates submitting new models and
input data is a material modification; and (2) how equipment changes for nonsynchronous resources will be treated under the proposed definition of material
modification and the proposed deadlines.2640

with imposing restrictions on when material modifications can be submitted (e.g., after

the initial application).2641 Ørsted asks the Commission to recognize that modifications
may occur at various stages of the process to reflect the use of evolving technology or to
meet federal or state requirements.2642 Ørsted acknowledges transmission providers’ time
and effort to conduct studies associated with proposed modifications but states that there
is also a need to balance the interests of the interconnection customer, as there are a
number of reasons why changes to an interconnection request may be necessary and
development time for resources must also be considered. Ørsted asserts that transmission
providers’ differing processes for assessing material modifications create regulatory
uncertainty for interconnection customers seeking to develop generating facilities in
different regions, which can have significant economic impacts for the generating
facility.2643 Ørsted states that, if the Commission chooses not to make the proposed
change to the modification process, then, at a minimum, the Commission should
encourage development of best practices that can be implemented by all the RTOs/ISOs
with the goal of increasing efficiency and regulatory certainty.
Shell asks the Commission to define the differences between “co-located
additive,” “co-located non-additive,” and “hybrid” resources, and explains that these
categories will allow transmission providers to develop proper criteria and business

practices governing additions and/or changes to pending interconnection requests.2644
Shell argues that, because transmission providers inconsistently apply the methods they
use to assess which issues qualify as being adverse material impacts, the Commission
should more clearly define the scope of an “adverse material impact” to ensure that
transmission providers consistently determine whether an interconnection request impacts
equally or lower-queued interconnection customer(s) to a sufficient level of harm.

Comments on Study Timeline

With respect to the study timeline, while NARUC supports the proposal to require
transmission providers to evaluate proposed generation additions within 60 calendar days
because it is a reasonable amount of time, it suggests that the Commission allow some
flexibility because planning regions and the industry may face challenges aligning
resources and expertise with increasingly aggressive schedules to perform complex
interconnection studies.2645 Public Interest Organizations, on the other hand, argue that
the 60-day timeline to perform an evaluation is critically important for continuing to
reduce delays in interconnection queue processing.2646 Cypress Creek supports the
concept of expedited study if the request for a modification does not change the level of
service, there is no impact on cost or timing of a request that is lower- or equally queued,

and it does not cause reliability concerns.2647 Tri-State asks how the 60-day time frame
would work with the cluster study process.2648 PJM opposes the 60-day timeline.2649

Comments on Control Technologies

ENGIE suggests that including control technologies in the evaluation of the
addition of a generating facility to an existing interconnection request should confirm the
lack of impact on other interconnection customers.2650 SEIA argues that transmission
providers should be transparent about requiring specific types of control technologies to
add an additional resource.2651 Clean Energy Associations contend that hardware or
software controls can also address, reliably and cost-effectively, concerns about the
impact of the use or addition of energy storage on the reliable operation and delivery of
energy (such as PJM’s concern regarding studies for light load conditions).2652

charges from the grid.2653 NV Energy states that any changes in the electrical
characteristics of the storage system in charging mode versus generating mode are most
likely negligible and unlikely to significantly impact studies.2654
APS explains that, based on its experience, the introduction of new load (not
electrical characteristics), such as storage charging from the grid in lieu of self-charging,
which could require changes to the system overall, could affect the results of the existing
study and other studies.2655
Public Interest Organizations state that the transmission provider should study
whether a storage generating facility’s charging and discharging load profiles may impact
the grid.2656 Public Interest Organizations argue that the interconnection customer and
transmission provider should work together to “identify the temporal and physical
charging characteristics to be agreed upon,” but that the Commission does not need to
further assess the details of the storage generating facilities charging because those
attributes will be tied to the unique properties of the transmission system at that location
and assessed during the interconnection process to ensure that charging load and
operational profiles do not adversely impact the system.

Miscellaneous Comments

PJM asks the Commission to restrict the ability to modify interconnection requests
after the initial application by allowing (1) an interconnection customer to move its point
of interconnection only in certain limited instances and (2) other specified modifications
only at certain specified times to avoid restudies and study delays.2657 PJM contends that
there is no need to study the materiality of a change in an interconnection request’s point
of interconnection because each such change requires analysis and the application of
engineering judgment, which takes time away from processing interconnection requests
and performing the cluster study. PJM claims that interconnection customers making
changes are really seeking to optimize their generating facilities mid-process rather than
performing due diligence before entering the interconnection queue.
With respect to the need for system impact studies, Illinois Commission argues
that, although in some cases additional studies are necessary in response to a request to
add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request to ensure reliability,
transmission providers should minimize repeating system impact studies to the extent
possible to avoid slowing down the interconnection queue.2658 In response to the concern
that evaluating modifications is time-consuming, Ørsted asks the Commission to allow

third-party consultants engaged by the interconnection customers to help inform any
studies related to modifications to reduce the workload on RTO/ISO staff.2659
PPL suggests that the transmission provider should assign an interconnection
queue position to the proposed additional generating facility.2660 PPL recommends the
study of the original and additional interconnection request together in the initial phase of
the interconnection process, and if they do not contribute to any network upgrades or
require any interconnection facilities, PPL suggests they should be able to proceed
directly to final agreements.
Pine Gate states that, if addition of a grid-charging storage resource is deemed a
material modification, the interconnection customer should be permitted to propose the
addition of a non-grid-charging electric storage resource as an alternative.2661 In order to
reduce the burden on transmission providers, Pine Gate asks the Commission to permit
interconnection customers to provide to transmission providers engineering analysis
applying what Pine Gate suggests would be published engineering criteria to the
requested modification and analyzing the impacts to other interconnection customers or
reliability, with the transmission provider then validating the results and determining if
the proposed modification is material.

Clean Energy Associations explain that if transmission providers study each
component of co-located generating facilities separately, a wind or solar generating
facility could obtain a faster study for ERIS while the co-located storage could get a more
detailed study for NRIS.2662 Clean Energy Associations assert that this flexibility would
provide transmission providers more visibility during interconnection processes, reduce
requests to retrofit generating facilities with additional co-located resources, and enable
faster interconnection processes for component resources that will accept curtailment.

Requests for Clarification and Flexibility

MISO asserts that, if the Commission adopts the proposal, the Commission should
modify the proposed requirement to allow the “proposed addition of a generating facility
to an interconnection request as long as the interconnection customer does not request a
change to the originally requested interconnection service level and the proposed addition
to the generating facility is modeled the same way as the original generating facility.”2663
Clean Energy Associations ask the Commission to clarify whether (1) generating
facility size reductions, which could result in upgrade costs being shifted to others in the
same cluster, would be a material modification and (2) there is a reduction threshold that
would trigger a material modification.2664

Invenergy asks the Commission to clarify that its proposed requirement to
evaluate requests to add a generating facility extends to requests for surplus
interconnection service and that those requests cannot automatically be deemed a
material modification.2665 Invenergy argues that, when the surplus interconnection
request is below the total original LGIA interconnection rights and determined a material
modification, the interconnection customer should have the opportunity to mitigate the
identified issue so that it is no longer a material modification.
Equinor Wind seeks clarification that the proposed definition of material
modification excludes changes that (1) occur on the interconnection customer’s side of
the point of interconnection and (2) do not alter the electrical output or electrical
characteristics of a generating facility, adding that such changes should not be subject to
the transmission provider’s discretion or evaluation of whether they amount to a material
modification.2666 Equinor Wind argues that these clarifications will reduce uncertainty
for interconnection customers and allow for some appropriate flexibility during
generating facility development, particularly for offshore wind. Equinor Wind asserts
that this clarification will not create reliability concerns because these changes do not
have transmission system impacts.

Requirements) and FAC-002-2 (Facility Interconnection Studies), asserting that the lack
of clarity and overlap between the two terms could cause confusion and may result in
additional delays to the interconnection process.2667 UMPA asks the Commission to
clarify that adding a generating facility includes technology changes beyond electric
storage resources, such as changing from wind to solar.2668
With respect to who performs the study to determine the impact of adding a
generating facility to an existing interconnection request, NARUC argues that, because
the reliable operation of the bulk-power system is at issue, the Commission should clarify
that the transmission providers determine whether (1) the addition of a generating facility
requires a full interconnection service study and (2) the interconnection customers in the
same cluster (or subsequent clusters) could be adversely impacted.2669 NARUC adds that
the Commission should ensure that these processes are transparent, clearly communicated
to interconnection customers, and allow interconnection customers to mitigate the
impacts and revise their modifications requests.

Omaha Public Power asks the Commission to allow transmission providers to

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modifications, the NOPR proposal to revise section 4.4.3 of the
pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers to evaluate the proposed addition of a
generating facility at the same point of interconnection prior to deeming such an addition
a material modification, if the addition does not change the originally requested
interconnection service level. We modify the NOPR proposal regarding section 4.4.3 of
the pro forma LGIP, as discussed in greater detail below, to: (1) remove the 60-calendar
day requirement for assessment of material modification; (2) limit the requirement that
the transmission provider analyze a request to add a generating facility to an existing

interconnection request solely to requests received prior to the interconnection customer’s
return of the executed facilities study agreement to the transmission provider; and
(3) create an exception for transmission providers that employ fuel-based dispatch
assumptions from these requirements.
We find that the record demonstrates that automatically deeming a request to add a
generating facility to an existing interconnection request to be a material modification
creates a significant barrier to access to the transmission system2673 and renders existing
interconnection processes unjust and unreasonable. Such default treatment deters
interconnection customers from proceeding with changes to a proposed generating
facility that, after review, may be found not to be material, thereby reducing the number
of generating facilities that can access the transmission system. This creates a barrier to
the addition of a generating facility to an existing interconnection request that may
improve the efficient use of the transmission system.
We make several modifications to the NOPR proposal in response to concerns
reflected in the record. First, we recognize that it may be difficult for some transmission
providers to complete their material modification evaluations within 60 calendar days,
depending on the details of their individual interconnection processes; therefore, we
decline to adopt a 60-calendar day requirement. This preserves flexibility for

transmission providers to address modification requests as is most efficient with their
overall interconnection queue processing.
Second, we modify the NOPR proposal to limit when an interconnection customer
may request to add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request without
such a request automatically being deemed a material modification. We are persuaded by
commenters’ arguments that allowing requests for evaluation to occur at any point in the
interconnection process could impede the ability of the transmission provider to timely
process its interconnection queue.2674 Thus, we modify the NOPR proposal, and
transmission providers will only be required to evaluate whether a request to add a
generating facility to an existing interconnection request is material if it is submitted
before the interconnection customer returns the executed facilities study agreement to the
transmission provider. Once the executed facilities study agreement is returned, the
transmission provider may decide to automatically treat requests to add a generating
facility to an existing interconnection request as material modifications without review.
We clarify that interconnection customers may continue to request changes to
proposed generating facilities at any time in the interconnection process. Transmission
providers that choose to evaluate modification requests later in the interconnection
process than required by this rule (i.e., after the interconnection customer returns the

executed facilities study agreement to the transmission provider) may continue to do so.
This final rule does not address how transmission providers evaluate modification
requests after the facilities study agreement, and thus transmission providers are not
required to include their modification processes after the facilities study agreement in
their compliance filing with this final rule.
We acknowledge that, as stated by commenters, transmission providers that
employ fuel-based dispatch assumptions, such as MISO, may experience challenges with
the proposal because the interconnection study assumptions in a fuel-based dispatch
model vary depending on the fuel type; thus a request to add a generating facility of a
different fuel type to an existing interconnection request would always constitute a
modification that would require a study, thereby affecting the interconnection costs or
study timing for lower- or equally-queued interconnection customers.2675 This type of
request would most likely represent a material modification and would result in the loss
of interconnection queue position under the tariff. Therefore, we modify the proposal to
include an exception for transmission providers that use fuel-based dispatch assumptions
in their interconnection studies.
In response to EPSA’s and Equinor Wind’s request to provide a clearer standard
definition of material modification,2676 we note that we are not changing the definition of
material modification in this rule and do not believe a more prescriptive definition of

material modification is reasonable given the nuances in transmission providers’
processes for assessing material modification, as described in the comments.2677 With
respect to NARUC’s request to clarify the flexibility transmission providers have in
determining what constitutes a material reliability concern on the transmission system,2678
we clarify that this reform only requires transmission providers to evaluate
interconnection modification requests. As stated above, it does not alter the definition of
material modification. Transmission providers may continue to find requests to be
material if they impact the cost or timing of an equally or lower-queued interconnection
customers.
Commenters request clarification about the requirements for demonstrating site
control when submitting a modification request.2679 In response, we clarify that, where a
modification request to add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request
requires the interconnection customer to adhere to a larger footprint to support a modified
facility design, the interconnection customer must provide evidence of the required site
control when submitting the modification request to the transmission provider. The
requirements for site control that the interconnection customer must adhere to may
depend on the timing of the request for the modification as well as the technology type of

the requested additional generating facility, as discussed in the site control portion of this
rule.2680
Indicated PJM TOs also request that the Commission clarify the relationship
between the term “material modification” in the pro forma LGIP and the term “materially
modify” in NERC Reliability Standard FAC-001-3.2681 We find that this request to
further define the relationship between the terms is outside of the scope of this
rulemaking. As discussed above, this final rule does not alter the preexisting definition of
a material modification. Moreover, we note that the Commission recently approved a
change to the NERC FAC Reliability Standards to change “materially modify” to
“qualifying change.”2682
ClearPath seeks clarification regarding equipment changes, specifically whether
under the proposed definition of material modification, a change in equipment that
necessitates submitting new models and input data is a material modification and how
equipment changes for non-synchronous resources will be treated under the proposed
definition of material modification and the proposed deadlines.2683 We clarify that an

equipment change, whether for synchronous or non-synchronous resources, that does not
change the originally requested interconnection service level and does not qualify for
evaluation under the transmission provider’s technological change procedure must be
evaluated by the transmission provider to determine if it is a material modification.
Similarly, Equinor Wind seeks clarification that the proposed definition of
material modification excludes changes that do not alter the electrical output or electrical
characteristics of an interconnection request, suggesting that such changes should not be
subject to the transmission provider’s discretion or evaluation of whether they amount to
a material modification.2684 We note that the definition of material modification is based
on whether changes have a material impact on the cost or timing of any interconnection
request with an equal or lower interconnection queue position, and thus we decline to
categorically exclude certain types of changes from the definition.
Clean Energy Associations ask the Commission to clarify whether: (1) generating
facility size reductions, which could result in upgrade costs being shifted to others in the
same cluster, would be a material modification; and (2) there is a reduction threshold that
would trigger a material modification.2685 We clarify that, as per pro forma LGIP section
4.4.1, prior to the return of the cluster study agreement from the transmission provider to
the interconnection customer, a decrease of up to 60% of electrical output (MW) must not
be considered a material modification. In addition, per pro forma LGIP section 4.4.2,

prior to the return of the executed interconnection facilities study, an additional 15%
decrease of electrical output of the proposed project must not be considered a material
modification if the change occurred either through a decrease in plant size (MW) or a
decrease in interconnection service level accomplished by applying transmission
provider-approved injection-limiting equipment.
Invenergy, in discussing both surplus interconnection and material modification,
contends that in circumstances where a surplus interconnection request is below the total
LGIA interconnection rights and determined to be a material modification, the
interconnection customer should have the opportunity to mitigate identified issues such
that there is no longer a material modification.2686 We find this request to be outside the
scope of this proceeding because the final rule is not proposing a process whereby
interconnection customers may mitigate identified issues to avoid a material modification
determination. In response to Invenergy’s request to clarify that the proposed reforms to
require evaluation of requests to add a generating facility extend to requests for surplus
interconnection service, the Commission declines to make such a change. The surplus
interconnection service process is separate from the material modification process, and
the two processes should not be conflated.
We decline to adopt firm guidelines that transmission providers will follow to
determine what constitutes a material modification when a request to add a generating
facility to an existing interconnection request involves adding co-located generating

interconnection customers may propose through this process may alter how they impact
equally or lower-queued interconnection customers, and therefore we find that
transmission providers must retain flexibility to evaluate these requests.

Availability of Surplus Interconnection Service

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission noted that Order No. 845 established a surplus
interconnection service process to enable a new interconnection customer to use the
unused portion of an existing interconnection customer’s approved interconnection
service through the inclusion of an additional generating facility behind a single point of
interconnection.2688 The Commission also noted that Order No. 845 did not specify when
a generating facility is considered to be “existing,” and preliminarily found that limiting
the use of surplus interconnection service to only interconnection customers that have
achieved commercial operation may be unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory
or preferential.2689

2687

We consider Shell’s request for the Commission to define the differences
between “co-located additive,” “co-located non-additive,” and “hybrid” resources, as well
as Shell’s request to specify the approach to charging energy, to be included among the
requests for firm guidelines.

Comments in Support

The vast majority of commenters on this topic either support or do not oppose the
proposal regarding surplus interconnection service, though some seek various
clarifications.2691 MISO states that surplus interconnection requests are the proper
method for interconnection customers to add storage or a different generating facility fuel
source to an interconnection request for an unbuilt generating facility2692 and suggests
that the Commission limit when the transmission provider must tender a surplus
interconnection agreement to the interconnection customer to prevent a surplus
interconnection agreement from being tendered prior to the original interconnection

agreement becoming effective. MISO explains that its generator interconnection
procedures allow for a surplus interconnection request to be made during the processing
of the interconnection queue and adds that MISO is not required to tender a surplus
interconnection agreement until the original interconnection agreement has become
effective because a surplus interconnection agreement is a derivative of the original
interconnection agreement. According to MISO, under the proposed reform, the surplus
interconnection agreement could be tendered prior to the original interconnection
agreement becoming effective if the original interconnection agreement is filed
unexecuted and becomes the subject of a disputed proceeding.

Comments in Opposition

Some commenters either argue that the NOPR proposal is inappropriate for their
situation or oppose it outright, in some cases arguing against the underlying concept of
surplus interconnection service. For instance, NYISO asserts that it does not provide for
the use of “surplus” interconnection service and the Commission has previously granted
NYISO an independent entity variation from the surplus interconnection service
requirement.2693 NYISO asserts that this independent entity variation remains just and
reasonable and accomplishes the purposes of Order No. 845 and the instant NOPR to

make it easier for proposed generating facilities to interconnect without costly
upgrades.2694
ISO-NE states that allowing for co-location of generating facilities meets the need
of allowing surplus interconnection service to be available after executing an LGIA,
rendering the proposed reform unnecessary.2695 ISO-NE explains that, unless the existing
generating facility is already commercial, there is no unused capability available at the
point of interconnection. ISO-NE asserts that, to the extent the interconnection customer
wants to co-locate generating facilities, it should be required to propose that as part of the
original interconnection request.
CAISO disagrees that allowing an interconnection customer to request surplus
interconnection service after the original interconnection customer executes an LGIA
would enable interconnection customers with unused interconnection capacity to let other
generating facilities use that capacity earlier than allowed.2696 CAISO contends that
interconnection customers do not request to use surplus interconnection service, and
further reform is unlikely to have much effect because surplus interconnection service is
unavailable independent of the Commission’s definition. CAISO asserts that
interconnection customers do not oversize their interconnection capacity; therefore, other

interconnection customers cannot avail themselves of any “surplus” because it is already
subscribed.
PJM asserts that the current surplus interconnection service construct provides no
value due to the challenges inherent in assessing the dynamic response associated with
adding a surplus generating facility to the system while not infringing on the rights of the
interconnection customers in the interconnection queue or available “headroom.”2697
Therefore, PJM contends that it sees no benefit in expanding its application and that
PJM’s current surplus interconnection service is rarely used. PJM asserts that surplus
interconnection service imposes overhead costs without providing value to
interconnection customers wishing to interconnect.
In response to PJM and CAISO’s comments, SEIA replies that both PJM and
CAISO take an overly narrow approach to surplus interconnection service and that past
use of surplus interconnection service should not bar making the service available to
future requests to add storage to a generating facility.2698

Comments on Specific Proposal

service should be available even earlier than proposed in the NOPR. For instance,

unexecuted, LGIA.2699 Ameren contends that, under the Commission’s proposal, MISO
and the interconnection customer would have finalized the network upgrades and system
impact study only to go back to assess what surplus interconnection capacity would have
been available. Therefore, Ameren asks the Commission to allow for regional flexibility.
Omaha Public Power likewise recommends that the Commission allow existing
transmission provider processes that are facilitating new technologies to continue.2700
Pine Gate favorably cites MISO’s process for surplus interconnection service and
asserts that the Commission should expand its current proposal to permit interconnection
customers to access the surplus interconnection service process upon completion of the
cluster restudy phase.2701 Invenergy states that the Commission should permit requests
for surplus interconnection service after an interconnection request has an executed
facilities study agreement.2702 Invenergy contends that the Commission could further
clarify that an LGIA must be in place for the initial facility before any LGIA for the
surplus interconnection service can be tendered. Invenergy asserts that, if the
Commission does not modify the NOPR, it should clarify that transmission providers like
MISO that have existing practices under which surplus interconnection service can be
requested earlier in the process may continue those existing practices in compliance

filings after any final rule may become effective. Invenergy also states that the
Commission should reinforce its commitment in Order No. 845 that surplus
interconnection service is available up to the maximum level allowed under the original
interconnection agreement.2703 According to Invenergy, some transmission providers
significantly limit an interconnection customer’s surplus interconnection rights by
deeming an otherwise permitted request a material modification except in the limited
situation of direct current (DC)-coupled behind-the-meter storage, which effectively
precludes surplus interconnection service in all other circumstances under a standard that
is not well-defined or explained.
Elevate encourages the Commission to consider modifying the duration of the
period in which an interconnection customer taking surplus interconnection service can
continue to operate following the original, host generating facility’s retirement.2704
Elevate contends that, although an interconnection customer taking surplus
interconnection service may operate for up to a year following the original generating
facility’s retirement, a one-year period is too short when it may take four years or more to
navigate the interconnection process. According to Elevate, a surplus interconnection
customer should be able to operate sufficiently long following the original generating
facility’s retirement that it has the ability to obtain permanent interconnection service

will ensure that generation capacity that has been fully constructed and is contributing to
system reliability is not unnecessarily forced offline due to interconnection queue
backlogs beyond their control.

Requests for Clarification

Shell contends that the Commission should clarify that transmission providers
cannot deny surplus interconnection capacity except where (1) the total amount of
interconnection service, measured in MW, at the point of interconnection has increased,
or (2) there will be a reliability risk to the relevant transmission system.2706
NARUC asks the Commission to clarify in the pro forma LGIP that an
interconnection customer that has been fully studied and has an executed LGIA, or has
filed an unexecuted LGIA, should be considered an existing facility for purposes of
surplus interconnection service.2707 NARUC asserts that this clarification will increase
efficiency in interconnection queues throughout the planning regions and ensure that
available interconnection capacity can be used efficiently.

and injection of two distinct, alternating current (AC)-coupled generating facilities is an

if the LGIA of the original interconnection request is suspended.2709 PacifiCorp explains
that, if the underlying LGIA is suspended, then there is no guarantee that the facilities
required for interconnection will be installed.2710 APS further asserts that, if an
interconnection customer requests to go into suspension after a surplus request is granted,
then that would also require the surplus interconnection to be suspended.2711 PacifiCorp
asserts that any work the transmission provider were to undertake relating to the surplus
interconnection service may be wasted effort if the LGIA never comes out of
suspension.2712 PacifiCorp asks the Commission to clarify that, if the original surplus
interconnection request exceeds its permitted suspension period, both the original LGIA
and any surplus interconnection service shall be terminated.

Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise section 3.3.1 of the pro forma LGIP to
require transmission providers to allow interconnection customers to access the surplus
interconnection service process once the original interconnection customer has an
executed LGIA or requests the filing of an unexecuted LGIA.
We find, based on the record, that this reform will enable interconnection
customers with unused interconnection service to let other generating facilities use that
interconnection service earlier than is currently allowed and, therefore, increases overall
efficiency of the interconnection queue.2714 Because we find this reform to be just and
reasonable, to remedy the unjust and unreasonable rates caused by the limited ability to
use surplus interconnection service today and ensure that interconnection customers are
able to interconnect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, we decline to
adopt alternative proposals suggested by commenters.
We find unpersuasive the comments from various RTOs/ISOs opposing the NOPR
proposal.2715 To the extent that they oppose the surplus interconnection service process

approved by the Commission in Order No. 845, we find their arguments to be a collateral
attack on the Commission’s findings in Order No. 845 and irrelevant for purposes of
determining whether the instant proposal is just and reasonable. Further, consistent with
the NOPR, we continue to find that expanding the availability of surplus interconnection
service beyond those entities that have achieved commercial operation will address the
Commission’s concerns regarding undue restrictions on access to this surplus
interconnection service,2716 thereby making it available to a broader group of potential
interconnection customers and achieving the efficiencies discussed above.
We are also not persuaded by either Pine Gate’s or Ameren’s arguments2717 to
alter the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to allow interconnection
customers to access the surplus interconnection service process prior to the LGIA phase
or Invenergy’s argument to allow requests for surplus interconnection service once there
is an executed facilities study agreement.2718 We find that allowing interconnection
customers to access the surplus interconnection service process once the original
interconnection customer obtains an executed LGIA, or requests the filing of an
unexecuted LGIA, is appropriate because prior to that stage, the network upgrades

necessary to create the identified amount of surplus interconnection service may not have
been fully identified, let alone begun the process of being placed into service.
In response to APS’s and PacifiCorp’s requests for clarification regarding
suspensions,2719 we clarify that: (1) if the LGIA of the original interconnection request is
suspended, then any submitted requests for surplus interconnection service are likewise
suspended, and new requests for surplus interconnection service may not be submitted,
until after the suspension is lifted; and (2) if the original LGIA is terminated, including
for exceeding the three-year suspension period (pursuant to pro forma LGIA article 5.16),
any related surplus interconnection service allowed as a result of the original LGIA will
be terminated because surplus interconnection service is dependent upon the underlying
interconnection service used by existing generating facilities.
In response to NARUC’s request to clarify that an interconnection customer that
has been fully studied and has an executed LGIA, or that has requested the filing of an
unexecuted LGIA, should be considered an existing facility for purposes of surplus
interconnection service, we decline to make such clarification, but reiterate that where an
interconnection customer has executed the LGIA, or requested that the LGIA be filed
unexecuted, interconnection customers may submit surplus interconnection service
requests to the transmission provider.

We find that Enel’s and Shell’s respective requests2720 for clarification regarding
establishing parameters on surplus interconnection service are outside the scope of this
proceeding because this final rule is not proposing to modify eligibility for surplus
interconnection service as established in Order No. 845.
We also find that Elevate’s request2721 for the Commission to modify the duration
in which an interconnection customer taking surplus interconnection service can continue
to operate following the original, host generating facility’s retirement is outside the scope
of this proceeding because this final rule is not proposing to modify the length of time for
which surplus interconnection service may be provided after the original generating
facility retires.
In response to Idaho Power’s request for clarification regarding whether the
Commission intends for the surplus interconnection service process to be used for an
interconnection customer that owns a generating facility with an executed or unexecuted
LGIA to later add energy storage,2722 the answer depends upon how the energy storage
facility will be used. If, for example, it is used only to firm up the underlying generating
facility (e.g., a wind or solar power plant) without ever injecting in excess of the original
interconnection service level, then surplus interconnection service may be used.2723 If, on

configured to inject together and exceed the original interconnection service limit, then
surplus interconnection service may not be used.
In response to Invenergy’s requests,2724 we clarify that the original interconnection
customer must have an LGIA in place, either executed or requested to be filed
unexecuted with the Commission, prior to tendering any LGIA for surplus
interconnection service. With respect to Invenergy’s request for flexibility for
transmission providers that currently allow requests for surplus interconnection service
before the LGIA phase, we note that transmission providers can propose deviations from
the requirements adopted in this final rule and demonstrate how those deviations satisfy
the standards discussed in Section IV of this final rule, which the Commission will
consider on a case-by-case basis.
In response to Invenergy’s request to clarify that proposed reforms to require
evaluation of requests to add a generating facility to an interconnection request extend to
requests for surplus interconnection service, we clarify that the revisions to the
modification process do not extend to the surplus interconnection service process. We
note that the modification process revisions would be used by an interconnection
customer while undergoing the interconnection study process, whereas the surplus
interconnection process revisions would be used after the interconnection study process is

Invenergy requests that the Commission reiterate and reinforce its commitment in
Order No. 845 that surplus interconnection service is available up to the maximum level
allowed under the original interconnection agreement. Invenergy contends that, when the
surplus interconnection service request is below the total LGIA interconnection rights
and determined to be a material modification, the interconnection customer should have
the opportunity to mitigate identified issues such that there is no longer a material
modification. We decline Invenergy’s request because the final rule does not address
revisions to how the surplus interconnection service process is conducted; rather, the final
rule addresses when a request for surplus interconnection service may be submitted.

Operating Assumptions for Interconnection Studies
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, as newer technologies with operating
parameters that differ from traditional generation seek to interconnect, it is necessary for
transmission providers to use assumptions that accurately reflect “the operating
parameters of electric storage resources and co-located resources containing electric
storage resources (including hybrid resources) so that the unique operating characteristics
of such resources are taken into account during the generator interconnection
process.”2725 The Commission stated that, because the pro forma LGIP includes only

- 927 -

general requirements regarding the operating assumptions for generating facilities in
interconnection studies, it was concerned that “electric storage resources, and co-located
resources containing electric storage resources, may be studied under inappropriate
operating assumptions that result in assigning unnecessary network upgrades and
increased costs to interconnection customers.”2726 The Commission therefore
preliminarily found that “the lack of realistic operating assumptions used in
interconnection studies for electric storage resources and co-located resources containing
electric storage resources (including hybrid resources) can result in excessive and
unnecessary network upgrades and may hinder the timely development of new
generation, thereby stifling competition in the wholesale markets, and resulting in rates,
terms, and conditions that are unjust and unreasonable.”2727 Further, the Commission
preliminarily found that “the lack of appropriate operating assumptions used in
interconnection studies may present an unduly discriminatory or preferential barrier to
the interconnection of electric storage resources and co-located resources containing
electric storage resources (including hybrid resources).”2728
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP to require transmission
providers, at the request of the interconnection customer, to use “operating assumptions
for interconnection studies that reflect the proposed operation of an electric storage

resource or co-located resource containing an electric storage resource (including hybrid
resources)—i.e., whether the interconnecting resource will or will not charge during peak
load conditions, unless good utility practice, including applicable reliability standards,
otherwise require the use of different operating assumptions.”2729 The Commission noted
that, under this proposed reform, such operating assumptions shall be proposed by the
interconnection customer as part of its initial interconnection request.
The Commission further proposed that such operating assumptions must be
“reasonably representative of the likely behavior of an electric storage resource or colocated resource containing an electric storage resource (including hybrid resources) and,
in cases where available, consistent with the historical performance of such resources in
the relevant geographic area.”2730 Further, to help facilitate alignment between as-studied
and real-world conditions, the Commission proposed to allow transmission providers to
“hold interconnection customers to the intended operation of their electric storage
resource or co-located resource containing an electric storage resource (including hybrid
resources) by: (1) memorializing these operating restrictions in the interconnection
customer’s LGIA; and (2) requiring control technologies (software and/or hardware) in
cases where appropriate, such as for electric storage that wishes to limit its operations,
with such protection devices included in Appendix C of the LGIA.”2731 The Commission

noted that, “if the interconnection customer fails to operate its electric storage resource or
co-located resource containing an electric storage resource (including hybrid resources)
in accordance with these conditions as memorialized in the LGIA, the interconnection
customer may be considered in breach and the transmission provider may pursue
termination pursuant to article 17 of the LGIA.”2732 Additionally, the Commission
proposed to “require that any transmission provider that requires electric storage
resources or co-located resources containing an electric storage resource (including
hybrid resources) to install control technologies to publicly post a list of acceptable
control technologies.”2733 Furthermore, the Commission proposed revisions to the
description of the ERIS and NRIS studies in sections 3.2.1.2. and 3.2.2.2 of the pro forma
LGIP to accommodate this proposed reform.
The Commission proposed to require that interconnection customers clearly
communicate to the transmission provider “the expected operating patterns of the electric
storage resource, or co-located resource containing an electric storage resource (including
hybrid resources).”2734 In addition, for “the electric storage resource or co-located
resource containing an electric storage resource (including hybrid resources) to be
studied, the Commission proposed to require the interconnection customer to specify, as
part of its initial interconnection request, the ancillary services that it would or would not

provide so that the proper operating assumptions may be made in interconnection
studies.”2735 Under the Commission’s proposal, regardless of any changes to operating
assumptions, “all electric storage resources, or co-located resources containing an electric
storage resource (including hybrid resources) would be required to continue to meet all
requirements in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA, as well as all applicable
reliability standards.”2736
The Commission noted that, under this proposed reform, each transmission
provider’s operating assumptions used in their interconnection studies must take into
consideration the services that the generating facility would provide and the timing of
such services, as applicable.2737 The Commission further noted that this could be done in
a variety of ways, and the transmission provider would have flexibility to consider
services as best fits its transmission system.
The Commission proposed to clarify that “this proposed reform to study electric
storage resources, or co-located resources containing an electric storage resource
(including hybrid resources) according to their planned operating assumptions at the
request of the interconnection customer as part of its initial interconnection request is
intended to mean the operating assumptions for withdrawals of energy (e.g., the charging

of an energy storage resource) in interconnection studies.”2738 The Commission proposed
to require that the interconnection customer include in its initial interconnection request
any operating assumptions for withdrawals of energy to be used by the transmission
provider in interconnection studies.
The Commission sought comment on whether the Commission should expand this
reform to address operating assumptions for additional generating facility technologies
that may currently be inaccurately modeled, such as variable energy resources.2739 For
example, the Commission sought comment on whether to expand this proposal to specify
only that, at the interconnection customer’s request, a transmission provider must not
study generating facilities in ways that are not physically possible, for example studying a
solar resource as producing energy at night, or a wind resource as producing maximum
energy during low wind seasons, or other circumstances wherein any resource is studied
in ways that are not physically possible, subject to the same proposed requirement that
the generating facility be equipped with sufficient control technology, such as special
protection systems, and/or subject to penalties for deviating from dispatch. The
Commission sought comment on whether other operating assumptions, in addition to the
assumption that electric storage resources withdraw energy during peak load periods,
should be considered as part of this proposed reform.

The Commission sought comment on how to define the study parameters (e.g.,
should the Commission define the peak load period and/or net peak load during which
transmission providers must not study a generating facility as withdrawing energy, and if
so how).2740
The Commission also sought comment on “whether, and if so how, to define firm
and non-firm charging for electric storage resources and require transmission providers to
define study criteria and possible ways to interconnect related to both firm and non-firm
charging.”2741 The Commission sought comment on whether providing such options
would improve the effectiveness of this proposed reform and whether there would be
other consequences of implementing such an approach. With respect to the definition of
firm and non-firm charging, the Commission sought comment on whether to: “(1) define
firm charging service as interconnection service that allows the interconnection customer
to be eligible to receive electric energy in a manner comparable to a transmission
provider’s load; and (2) define non-firm charging service as interconnection service that
allows the interconnection customer to be eligible to receive electric energy using the
existing firm or non-firm capacity of the transmission system on an ‘as available’ basis,

Many commenters agree with the Commission that the lack of realistic operating
assumptions used in interconnection studies for electric storage resources and co-located

excessive and unnecessary network upgrades and hinder the timely development of new

that using unrealistic operating assumptions in interconnection studies creates an unduly

and co-located resources containing electric storage resources (including hybrid

Many commenters agree with the Commission that the assumptions used in
interconnection studies for the charging of electric storage resources should closely
resemble the expected “real-world” operation of such resources.2745 For example,
NextEra asserts that operating assumptions should reflect the rational economic dispatch
of electric storage and co-located resources and that interconnection customers with

electric storage resources should be allowed to request a lower maximum allowed
charging rate in place of being assigned network upgrade cost allocations.2746 Shell
asserts that parameters used to study storage should consider market conditions.2747
Many commenters argue that assuming in an interconnection study that an electric
storage resource will withdraw energy during peak demand similar to firm end-use
customer demand fails to recognize the real-time attributes of electric storage resources,
such as the ability to respond within seconds to prices and dispatch signals from the
transmission provider.2748 For example, NARUC and NESCOE argue that studying
electric storage resources using worst-case operating assumptions, such as withdrawing
energy during peak demand, ignores the real-time attributes and benefits of these
technologies, such as their ability to respond within seconds to prices and dispatch signals
from transmission providers and inject electricity during peak demand conditions.2749
Further, Union of Concerned Scientists asserts that modeling storage as charging during
times of peak demand penalizes interconnection customers for trying to locate electric
storage resources in places where they are most needed (e.g., load pockets) because the

study inappropriately models electric storage resources as contributing to the problem of
transmission congestion rather than relieving it.2750 AEP argues that some electric
storage resources do occasionally charge during peak demand; however, AEP has no
objection to electric storage resources being studied under a certain set of operating
conditions as long as operating restrictions are imposed through interconnection
agreements and the resource owner/operator recognizes that it must abide by dispatch
orders and bear the consequences of any limitations on its operation that result in
penalties.2751

Comments in Opposition

Some commenters argue that the proposed reform is overly burdensome on
transmission providers and could add time and complexity to the interconnection
process.2752 For example, NYISO opposes the proposed reform, arguing that it would not

Some commenters oppose the proposed reform due to reliability concerns.2754
PJM argues that the proposal would be extremely difficult to police and enforce and
would not guarantee that units will operate within their studied parameters, putting PJM
at operational risk.2755 Southern opposes the proposed reform, stating that transmission
providers are ultimately responsible for planning for the safety and reliable operation of
their transmission systems, which includes standard assumptions for interconnection
studies.2756 Southern contends that it may be viable to provide an information-only
scenario using the assumptions provided by the interconnection customer, but it would
not be just and reasonable to allow interconnection customers to dictate the study
assumptions for their electric storage, hybrid, or co-located resources. NYISO asserts
that its interconnection studies are designed to capture extreme system scenarios to best
maintain the reliability of the system and to be prepared for rare extreme conditions and
without such planning, the interconnection studies could fail to identify essential nonlocal network upgrades.2757 SDG&E argues that the reform may introduce undue risk
into the interconnection study process and could lead to the transmission system being
operated in an unstudied/unplanned state.2758

However, several commenters disagree that the proposed reform will introduce
undue risk into the interconnection study process and real-time operations.2759 CESA
asserts that many transmission providers continue to use historical planning standards
that do not consider the capability of advanced firmware and software controls to
dispatch resources in accordance with operating assumptions that can provide much
needed additional capacity to the transmission system, which may result in continued
delays and inefficiencies in the interconnection process.2760
NARUC suggests that, in RTO/ISO regions, independent market monitors may be
well-positioned to track deviations from proposed operational limits in real-time
operations.2761 For non-RTO/ISO regions, NARUC contends that it may be appropriate
for an independent transmission monitor or NERC regional reliability entity to serve in
such a role.

also believes that operating assumptions used in interconnection studies should be limited
to factors that can be automatically controlled by the interconnection customer;
otherwise, system issues may occur when interconnection facilities are operating outside
of the assumptions used in the studies.2764 Although AEP generally supports the
proposed reform because interconnection studies should be as accurate as possible, AEP
notes that using operating assumptions provided by the interconnection customer may
complicate studies and thus realistic study time frames must be adopted.2765
Many commenters support the proposal to allow transmission providers to require
the use of controls to ensure compliance with planned operation.2766 Clean Energy
Associations argue that electric storage resources are controllable with a level of

proposed reform would acknowledge the fact that electric storage resources are highly
controllable through hardware and software controls.2768 SEIA asserts that power control
systems, which electronically limit or control steady state currents to a programmable
limit, can ensure that electric storage resources follow operating assumptions, and that
their use is growing.2769
Idaho Power states that it currently has a generator control and monitoring
technology that can be leveraged for monitoring and controlling electric storage

outages, which would likely require upfront and ongoing costs for both Idaho Power and
interconnection customers. Idaho Power requests that the Commission consider

storage resource does not follow its schedule.
Eversource states that it is essential for system operators and transmission planners
to have sufficient visibility and controls in place to ensure that the transmission system is
not placed in unstudied and potentially insecure N-1 contingency states.2771 Eversource
suggests that this issue, as well as other issues of grid dispatch, should be the subject of
its own proceeding. Alternatively, Eversource requests that the Commission require that
interconnection customers with proposed operational study assumptions have
technological controls in place that automatically limit the electric storage facility’s
operation to the proposed operational parameters. Eversource further requests that the
Commission reflect these requirements in the body of the pro forma LGIA, and not only
the appendices.
NARUC and Public Interest Organizations support the proposed requirement to
consider resources to be in breach of their LGIA if they fail to operate as intended.2772

installing control technologies would allow the transmission provider and interconnection
customer to engage in an interactive dialogue to develop a set of operating assumptions
that both satisfy the interconnection customer’s operational desires and align with “good
utility practice.” 2774
rPlus generally supports the proposal but argues that the proposed termination
requirements for the interconnection customer should the operational characteristics not
be met are too stringent and restrictive.2775 rPlus agrees that it is important to
memorialize the studied operational assumptions in the interconnection agreement but
asserts that it would benefit from the inclusion of additional language should deviation
from the originally defined operational assumptions be beneficial. Therefore, rPlus
suggests that the Commission remove any explicit or implied requirement for electric
storage resources not to charge during peak load periods and add language to retain the
possibility of altering the operational characteristics when these changes would benefit
the reliable and efficient operation of the transmission system or benefit ratepayers.
Invenergy supports the proposed reform to accommodate study assumptions that

to occasionally operate outside those conditions, those concerns should be addressed
through the regional transmission planning process, rather than forcing interconnection
customers to fund upgrades that are rarely if ever needed.2777
Several commenters suggest modifications to the proposal to better achieve the
Commission’s goal. For example, Pine Gate suggests that the Commission require
transmission providers to use a uniform set of minimum interconnection study
requirements (e.g., by eliminating the use of extreme contingency scenarios and overly
conservative operational characteristics and strategies) to facilitate effective, efficient
interconnection queue processing, which is an essential prerequisite of consumer
protection.2778 With respect to the provision of ancillary services, Pine Gate requests that
the interconnection customer not be required to definitively indicate the specific ancillary
services that it would or would not provide in the initial interconnection request because
it is not possible for the interconnection customer to know with certainty which ancillary
services it may be eligible to provide when it is ultimately placed in service.2779 For this
reason, Pine Gate requests that the Commission require the interconnection customer to
list in the original interconnection request only whether it intends to provide ancillary
services generally.2780

Union of Concerned Scientists urges the Commission to direct in the final rule that
technical capabilities offered by an interconnection customer be appropriately recognized
and used in the modeling of transmission impacts and their mitigation, including the
ability to respond to contingencies and provide dynamic real or reactive power, which if
omitted could lead to millions of dollars of costs to customers to provide such capability
by other means.2781
Interwest supports allowing interconnection customers to request that transmission
providers apply certain study assumptions to better approximate realistic operations and
requiring transmission providers to apply congestion management practices to unusual
events, developed through regional transmission planning processes, rather than building
in assumptions assuming worst-case operations scenarios.2782
Public Interest Organizations recommend that, if a transmission provider finds an
interconnection customer’s proposed operating assumptions to be in conflict with “good
utility practice,” the transmission provider should be required to provide the
interconnection customer with a clear explanation of why the submitted operating
assumptions are insufficient or inappropriate, and allow the interconnection customer to
revise and resubmit the proposed operating assumptions as necessary, within a reasonable

Clean Energy Associations urge the Commission to define study parameters such
as “peak load” and “net peak load.”2784 Clean Energy Associations request that the
Commission define “net peak load” as the period during which transmission providers
must not study a facility as withdrawing energy. Clean Energy Associations note that in
regions with high solar penetration, the net peak load hour diverges from the peak load
hour and migrates to later in the day and, under these conditions, low prices during the
peak load hour may create incentives for storage to charge, whereas prices would be high
during the net peak load hour creating incentives to discharge. Therefore, Clean Energy
Associations contend that using the net peak load as the period of study will ensure that
studies continue to accurately reflect expected economic price response of storage as
system conditions evolve.
NextEra and Clean Energy Associations urge the Commission to require
transmission providers to use additional study assumptions beyond just whether electric
storage and co-located resources (including hybrid resources) should charge during peak
load periods. Both NextEra and Clean Energy Associations argue that transmission
providers should not study electric storage resources as injecting energy during low load
and shoulder periods because that does not reasonably reflect the rational economic
behavior and typical operations of such resources.2785

In contrast, MISO argues against requiring additional study assumptions for
electric storage resources.2786 MISO notes that there may be times in the future when
renewable resources are constrained or unavailable due to the lack of fuel (e.g., no wind
or sun) such that the MISO transmission system will need to call upon electric storage
resources for injection: but, if these resources are not permitted to discharge due to their
operational assumptions, then the transmission system’s reliance on those resources could
lead to reliability risks.
Several other commenters urge the Commission not to define study parameters,
such as “peak load” or “net peak load,” and instead allow for regional flexibility.2787 For
example, rather than define peak load, Microgrid Resources states that the Commission
should require individual evaluation of the expected operating assumptions for the
resource(s) being studied.2788 Enel asserts that it does not believe clear and transparent
criteria regarding the peak load period could be developed such that the limitations on a
generating facility could appropriately be modeled with only a few power flow model
“snapshots in time” serving as the basis for the restriction.2789

Several commenters support eliminating unrealistic interconnection study

that a solar facility will operate a night, or that a wind resource will produce maximum
output during low-wind seasons.2790 Ameren, Cypress Creek, Microgrid Resources,
NARUC, Pine Gate, and rPlus all request that the Commission extend this reform to
allow any resource type, not just electric storage or co-located resources, to request that
interconnection studies be based on their particular operating assumptions and
characteristics.2791 NARUC further asserts that it is reasonable to allow interconnection
customers to request that transmission providers not study interconnecting generating
facilities in ways that are not physically possible, subject to the same proposed
requirement that the generating facility be equipped with sufficient control technologies
and penalties for deviations.2792 Microgrid Resources urges the Commission to define

whole.2793
Pattern Energy asserts that transmission providers should be required to update
their operating assumptions annually, after stakeholder input.2794 Pattern Energy asserts
that some transmission providers require light-load reliability analysis for wind resources
but not for natural gas plants, which is unduly discriminatory.2795
Some commenters support expanding the proposed reforms to the entire facility of
hybrid or co-located resources. For instance, ENGIE recommends that interconnection
customers submitting hybrid or co-located resources should be able to specify operating
parameters across the entire generating facility, including variable energy resources,
within their interconnection request to allow interconnection customers to reflect
parameters such as solar-based charging of the electric storage resource more
accurately.2796 Pine Gate states that co-located resources are typically studied
independently, which requires studying the combined maximum injection of the two
generating facilities that are co-located, despite the fact that studying in this manner
overestimates the impact on the transmission system and could trigger unnecessary

regarding operating assumptions for electric storage resources and co-located resources,
the Commission should permit an interconnection customer to specify the proposed
operation of all components of a co-located resource in its interconnection request. SEIA
contends that studying two, co-located resources as a single resource would be more
accurate, as this would reflect the actual electrical impact to the transmission system.2798
Although not entirely opposed to the proposed reform, PacifiCorp asserts that this
proposed reform should not be extended to co-located and hybrid resources because
monitoring and enforcing operational limitations could be complex, and incorporating
operational limitations could complicate the cluster study process.2799 Nevertheless,
PacifiCorp encourages the Commission to permit transmission providers to opt-in to
extending this type of reform to hybrid resources if appropriate for their systems.
Several other commenters urge the Commission to go further and require
transmission providers to use more realistic operating assumptions without requiring the
interconnection customer to request that transmission provider do so.2800 Public Interest

prevent unduly discriminatory treatment.2801 Therefore, Public Interest Organizations
recommend that the Commission require transmission providers to work with
interconnection customers to ensure operating assumptions reflect physical, operational,
and market realities, “good utility practice,” and applicable reliability standards. AES
Clean Energy argues that the Commission should require transmission providers to
establish a process to revisit and update operating assumptions of different resource types
in consultation with stakeholders to ensure that these operating assumptions are realistic
and approximately reflect the expected actual operation of these resources.2802
Shell supports the use of accurate modeling assumptions, including for variable
energy resources, but argues that electric storage and renewable resources should not be
treated in the same way because electric storage is dispatchable and renewable resources
generally are not dispatchable.2803 Further, Shell asserts that the Commission should not
assume all wind and solar resources are the same (and not dispatchable).
AECI and NextEra oppose extending the proposed reform to other resources
types.2804 NextEra opposes extending customized operating assumptions to wind and
solar energy resources because doing so could unduly complicate subsequent operational

on resources when needed.2805 AECI proposes to continue studying wind and solar
resources as NRIS facilities that are dispatched at 100% to avoid potential reliability
issues at the worst times.2806 MISO explains that it currently requires interconnection
customers to be responsible for limiting and controlling their own dispatch in some
conditions, but that it has no ability to monitor in real time if an interconnection customer
violates its operating limits.2807 MISO states that it is unaware of any plant side control
device or operational tool that MISO could use to prevent a generating facility’s injection
to enforce an electric storage resource’s operating assumptions regarding discharging.
Idaho Power states that it is unclear how a cluster study with multiple interconnection
requests could be performed when accounting for numerous and potentially conflicting
study parameters, such as “low wind season” for one interconnection customer but not for
another.2808 Idaho Power seeks clarification of the definition of study parameters such as
“low wind season.”

example, Clean Energy Associations support enabling interconnection customers with
electric storage resources and hybrid resources to request non-firm transmission service
for their charging energy, provided that transmission providers update study criteria and
interconnection processes for such service accordingly and provide definitions of firm
and non-firm charging service for electric storage resources.2810 CESA argues that
electric storage resources should not be forced to use one type of charging service over
another since some resources may find it sufficient to take advantage of charging
capacity as it is available whereas others may want or need greater assurances of charging
capacity and are willing to pay for the requisite network upgrades.2811 CESA urges the
Commission to set requirements as to how partial or full firm charging services should be
offered on a flexible, as-requested basis, such that an interconnection customer can seek
firm charging service for specific time windows or for a portion of the electric storage
resource’s nameplate or interconnection capacity. CESA asserts that, as discussed in the
NOPR, accommodating firm and as-available charging service options should reflect the
operating capabilities of the storage resource (i.e., price responsive, dispatchable),
achieve efficient market outcomes, and avoid expensive and unnecessary upgrades.”2812

Clean Energy Associations assert that the Commission should direct transmission
providers to use the following criteria for studying interconnection requests that opt for
non-firm charging service: (1) the electric storage resource should have the option to
receive electric energy using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the transmission
system on an “as available” basis; (2) any study of an electric storage resource charging
should allow the interconnection customer to elect to use a lower charging level or a
control technology to mitigate any identified constraints in lieu of being assigned network
upgrades to address such constraints; and (3) the electric storage resource should receive
information relative to any network upgrades, charging restrictions, or control
requirements in advance of signing an interconnection agreement.2813 Clean Energy
Associations urge the Commission to direct transmission owners to indicate conditions
under which charging energy could be curtailed in interconnection agreements that
include non-firm service for charging energy. Clean Energy Associations also caution
that the Commission should avoid recategorizing charging energy of electric storage
resources as a wholesale load, which would be contrary to the Commission’s findings in
Order No. 841.
AEP suggests that clarifications would be needed for the proposed definitions of
firm and non-firm charging to be effective. For example, AEP asserts that the proposed
definitions for firm and non-firm charging service conflate different products and

services required to charge an electric storage resource.2814 AEP argues that charging
service is not a form of interconnection service, nor is interconnection service referred to
in the industry as firm or non-firm. According to AEP, it is the delivery service (i.e.,
transmission and wholesale distribution service) that can be firm or non-firm and
therefore the relevant question is whether, in the interconnection process, an electric
storage resource can or needs to request to be studied as a “firm” or “non-firm” load for
delivery purposes. AEP asserts that the Commission should recognize that, for electric
storage resources, the interconnection cluster study process should include an analysis of
transmission service. AEP notes that the Commission has permitted the California
utilities to study the need for wholesale distribution upgrades required for charging on a
firm basis as part of the interconnection study process. AEP argues that, if it is
technically possible to distinguish loads, a load that affects human safety, health, and
welfare directly should have priority over the charging of an electric storage resource,
unless for example, if the electric storage resource will be used for blackstart after an
outage, adding that the final rule does not need to interfere with emergency load shedding
protocols.
Shell asserts that the need for firm or non-firm transmission service will vary by
generating facility, as well as by the usage pattern of the electric storage resource (e.g.,
whether the electric storage resource is standalone or part of a hybrid resource that is AC-

coupled, DC-coupled, or DC-tight-coupled).2815 Shell states that, if an electric storage
resource is charging from the transmission system as non-firm load, and the resource
owner is required to comply with the transmission provider’s real-time dispatch orders to
cease charging from the transmission system due to reliability concerns, then there is no
need for long-term firm transmission service reservations to serve the electric storage
resource. Shell contends that non-firm electric storage load should not be required to
acquire transmission service prior to charging from the transmission system, as such
charging will be captured by the revenue meter and can be billed at the transmission
provider’s non-firm point-to-point transmission rate at the end of the billing period.
Xcel suggests that the evaluation of non-firm charging must assume a price and
then the electric storage resource should be bound to that price.2816 Xcel contends that, if
an electric storage resource is studied as non-firm load but ends up offering to buy energy
in the market above average market prices, the study will not represent the resulting
dispatch. Therefore, Xcel recommends that electric storage resources and other non-firm
load should be required to have a maximum bid price that is included in Attachment C of
the pro forma LGIA.

requiring transmission providers to define study criteria as part of this rulemaking.2817

timing of submitting operating assumptions.2819 Clean Energy Associations and ENGIE
recommend that the Commission define a clear decision point in the interconnection
study process before which interconnection customers may adjust operating assumptions

transmission system disturbances, which goes beyond “as available” service and does not
allow for lower-cost mitigation options.2822 For these reasons, Enel recommends that the
Commission direct transmission providers to replace power flow studies with Security
Constrained Economic Dispatch analysis for ERIS service studies instead of the
Commission’s proposed reform,2823 or in the alternative, require appropriately supported

realistic fuel-based dispatch assumptions to all resource types.2825 Additionally,
Invenergy notes that both MISO and SPP already use realistic fuel-based dispatch
assumptions in their interconnection study processes.2826 Although MISO believes that a
fuel-based dispatch methodology would address the concerns stated in the NOPR about
unrealistic operating assumptions, MISO also believes that study methods should be
flexible to the unique needs of a region’s stakeholders and that the Commission should
allow flexibility regarding how a transmission provider conducts its studies.2827 MISO

asserts that fuel-based dispatch enables more efficient generator interconnection because
it recognizes that not all generating facilities will be dispatched up to their requested
interconnection service at all times of the year and that some fuels will not be dispatched
when other fuels are being dispatched.2828 MISO explains that its current fuel dispatch
method also addresses withdrawal for electric storage resources and was informed by
operational data.2829

requirement that would ensure operational and market realities are appropriately reflected

Organizations state that this could include both operational practices and procedures as
well as market-based price signals for curtailment and congestion management.
Furthermore, Public Interest Organizations contend that fossil generating facilities should
not be expected to generate at or near peak output during times when market prices are
depressed, such as during periods of high renewable generation.2831

Comments Regarding Transmission Service
Request Studies

Clean Energy Associations note that some RTOs/ISOs determine the network
upgrades needed to accommodate the charging of electric storage resources as part of the
interconnection process, whereas other transmission providers do so in the transmission
service request process.2838 Similarly, Xcel states that charging from the transmission
system can be evaluated and approved through the designation of a new delivery point as
part of a transmission service request.2839 Xcel further notes that it is unaware of a
transmission service study process defined in the pro forma tariff that specifically
evaluates non-firm load. Puget Sound states that it currently studies charging outside of
the interconnection process and recognizes that charging could be considered a retail or a
transmission product once the load piece is interconnected.2840 However, Puget Sound
asserts that charging should be studied in the interconnection process, and the
transmission provider should be granted more time to study this additional element.

Puget Sound seeks clarity as to whether the proposed reform means that charging should
now be considered part of the interconnection process, or if it can be part of the process
should the transmission provider wish to include it. Further, Puget Sound argues that the
Commission should standardize the pro forma LGIA to include specific operating
assumptions to avoid interconnection request delays due to needing to file a nonconforming LGIA with the Commission and/or interconnection customer hesitancy.
In contrast, Tri-State argues that it is inappropriate to study charging of electric
storage resources within a generator interconnection study, and instead asserts that this
type of analysis is best performed as a part of a transmission service study, which covers
delivery of energy to load or charging of an electric storage resource.2841 Similarly, SPP
argues that evaluating the impact of an electric storage resource’s charging on the
transmission system is better suited to other existing processes designed to assess load
impact, such as the long-term transmission service study process, the short-term
transmission service evaluation process, or market processes.2842

providers may need to study electric storage or co-located resources based on worst-case
operating assumptions to understand the potential impact these resources would have on
the transmission system absent operating restrictions being implemented. However, Pine
Gate requests that the Commission clarify that network upgrade costs will not be
assigned to the interconnection customer based on the unrealistic worst-case scenarios
where there is agreement to implement operating restrictions.
Elevate requests that the Commission clarify that the proposed reform applies to
all study processes related to the interconnection of electric storage resources, including
generator replacement, surplus interconnection, and requests to modify an existing
generation resource, arguing that there is no reason for the Commission to require that
transmission providers use realistic study parameters only in the context of requests for
new interconnection service while allowing unrealistic study assumptions in other study
processes.2844
CAISO is concerned that, if not modified, the proposed reform would require
transmission providers to provide firm charging options, whereas CAISO asserts that it
does not currently provide firm charging service and stakeholders have never requested
such service.2845 CAISO argues that requiring firm charging service would have a
profound impact on organized electricity markets and asserts that if the Commission

whenever they desire—even during stressed peak conditions—it should do so expressly
and not in the context of a rulemaking addressing interconnection. CAISO asserts that
the Commission should consider a simple clarification and avoid requiring transmission
providers to offer firm charging, but instead require transmission providers that offer firm
charging to allow interconnection customers to request it at the outset of their
interconnection request.
Environmental Defense Fund urges the Commission to clarify that an apparent
failure to operate in accordance with agreed-upon conditions should be treated as a
normal alleged default or breach as governed by article 17 of the pro forma LGIA, which
would not result in immediate termination.2846 Environmental Defense Fund asserts that
the requirements of article 17.1 of the pro forma LGIA state that a breaching party be
given an opportunity to cure the breach and that termination is only available if the
breaching party fails to cure or the breach is not capable of being cured. Similarly,
Hydropower Commenters generally support the proposal, but believe that the proposed
requirement that if an interconnection customer fails to operate its electric storage
resource in accordance with the operating assumptions memorialized in the
interconnection agreement, the interconnection customer may be considered in breach
and the transmission provider may pursue termination of the interconnection agreement,
is overly restrictive, will discourage the development of pumped storage projects, and

should be modified.2847 Instead, Hydropower Commenters urge the Commission to
provide for a standard cure period to address deviations, and penalties in the event of
failure to cure.
MISO states that the proposed reform is unclear because the text of the NOPR
states that the Commission intends operating instructions to only apply to an electric
storage resource’s ability to describe how it will withdraw energy from the transmission
system (i.e., charge a battery), whereas the proposed pro forma LGIP revisions state that
the operating assumptions can also apply to the manner the interconnection request states
that the electric storage resource will discharge.2848 MISO asks that the Commission
clarify that the text of the NOPR is correct, and that the Commission did not intend to
propose to allow electric storage resources to define the operating assumptions for how
they will inject into the transmission system because, according to MISO, allowing
interconnection requests to define operating assumptions regarding discharge would
result in operational problems and would be discriminatory to other generating facilities.
Hydropower Commenters suggest that the proposed reform be modified to include
a simplified procedure for amending an interconnection customer’s interconnection
agreement to optimize the operating parameters of a pumped storage plant to the extent
the transmission system is available.2849

Some commenters note that several transmission providers already study electric
storage resources using more realistic operating assumptions and assert that transmission
providers should have the flexibility to determine the assumptions used when studying
generating facilities interconnecting to the transmission system, including operating
assumptions for electric storage resources, while also factoring in input from the
interconnection customer.2850 NESCOE argues that the final rule should require
transmission providers to work with the relevant states, transmission owners, electric
storage resource interconnection customers, and stakeholders in their region to develop
modeling assumptions for electric storage resources that are reasonable, realistic, and
ensure the ability to interconnect is offered on a non-discriminatory basis.2851
National Grid recommends that the Commission provide regional flexibility to
adopt or decline this proposed reform after transmission providers receive input from
their stakeholders to determine if ad hoc proposed operating assumptions for
interconnection requests are reasonable and appropriate or if certain pre-determined
acceptable ranges of assumptions are consistent with reliability.2852 APPA-LPPC argues
that the proposal could entail creating entirely new models for off-peak scenarios, not just
running sensitivity analyses from an existing model, and therefore urges the Commission

3.2.1.2, 3.2.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.4.2, 4.4.3, 7.3, 8.2, and Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP and

the request of the interconnection customer, to use operating assumptions in
interconnection studies that reflect the proposed charging behavior of electric storage

not charge during peak load conditions—unless good utility practice, including
applicable reliability standards,2857 otherwise requires the use of different operating

An electric storage resource is a generating facility capable of receiving
electric energy from the grid and storing it for later injection of electricity.
2855

As noted above, co-located generating facilities are more than one generating
facility that are located on the same site and that are connected at the same point of
interconnection that are operated and dispatched as separate generating facilities. See
supra Section III.C.1.a.iii.
2856

As noted above, a hybrid generating facility is a generating facility composed
of more than one device of different technology types for the production and/or storage
for later injection of electricity that are located on the same site and are operated and
dispatched as a single integrated generating facility. See supra Section III.A.6.b.iii.
2857

Applicable reliability standards means “the requirements and guidelines of the
Electric Reliability Organization and the Balancing Authority Area of the Transmission
System to which the Generating Facility is directly interconnected.” See pro forma LGIP

assumptions.2858 We clarify that studying electric storage resources, at the request of the
interconnection customer, according to their planned operating assumptions means only
the operating assumptions for withdrawals of energy (e.g., the charging of an electric
storage resource) in interconnection studies.
We find that by more accurately reflecting the technical capabilities of electric
storage resources in interconnection studies through the use of appropriate operating
assumptions, this reform ensures the reliable interconnection of new electric storage
resources without overestimating their impact on the transmission system, thereby
ensuring just and reasonable rates by avoiding excessive and unnecessary network
upgrades that may hinder the timely development of new generating facilities that stifles
competition in the wholesale market. We also find that reflecting the technical
capabilities of electric storage resources through the use of appropriate operating
assumptions in interconnection studies reduces unduly discriminatory or preferential
barriers to the interconnection of electric storage resources.
We adopt the proposed revisions, subject to modification, to section 3.1.2 of the
pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers, at the request of the interconnection
customer, to use operating assumptions that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an

section 1 (Definitions).
2858

For clarity, we note that the reforms described in this determination section
and the related sections of the pro forma LGIP apply to all interconnecting electric
storage resources, whether they are standalone, co-located generating facilities, or part of
a hybrid generating facility.

electric storage resource, allow interconnection customers to resubmit their operating
assumptions if the transmission provider finds the originally proposed operating
assumptions are in conflict with good utility practice, and allow the transmission provider
to require the interconnection customer to install additional control technologies. We
agree with Public Interest Organizations that transparency is necessary when a
transmission provider finds that an interconnection customer’s operating assumptions
conflict with good utility practice.2859 Therefore, we modify the proposed revisions to
section 3.1.2 of the pro forma LGIP to require that, if a transmission provider finds an
interconnection customer’s proposed operating assumptions to be in conflict with good
utility practice, the transmission provider must provide the interconnection customer with
a clear explanation in writing of why the submitted operating assumptions are insufficient
or inappropriate by no later than 30 calendar days before the end of the customer
engagement window and allow the interconnection customer to revise and resubmit the
proposed operating assumptions one time at least 10 calendar days before the end of the
customer engagement window.
We adopt the proposed revisions to section 3.2.1.2 of the pro forma LGIP to
require transmission providers to study electric storage resources that request ERIS
service according to the interconnection customer’s proposed operating assumptions. We
adopt the proposed revisions to section 3.2.2.2 of the pro forma LGIP to require

according to the interconnection customer’s proposed operating assumptions.
We agree with Elevate and clarify that the reform to use operating assumptions in
interconnection studies, at the request of the interconnection customer, that reflect the
proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource applies to the operating
assumptions used in all study processes related to the interconnection of electric storage
resources. Accordingly, we modify the NOPR proposal to require transmission
providers, at the request of the interconnection customer, to use operating assumptions
that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource in additional
study processes, as described below.
With respect to surplus interconnection service, we modify the NOPR proposal to
revise section 3.3.1 of the pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers, at the
request of the interconnection customer, to use operating assumptions that reflect the
proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource in the surplus interconnection
service process.
We adopt the proposed revisions to section 3.4.2 of the pro forma LGIP to require
interconnection customers to include in their interconnection request the proposed
operating assumptions that reflect the proposed charging behavior of the electric storage
resource and a description of any control technologies that will limit the operation of the
electric storage resource to its intended operation.
To the extent an interconnection customer requests to modify a generating facility
already in the interconnection queue by adding an electric storage resource to the

accordance with section 4.4.3 of the pro forma LGIP using operating assumptions that
reflect the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource, at the request of
the interconnection customer. Accordingly, we modify the NOPR proposal to revise
section 4.4.3 of the pro forma LGIP to require transmission providers, at the request of
the interconnection customer, to use operating assumptions that reflect the proposed
charging behavior of an electric storage resource in the material modification process.
We adopt the proposed revisions to section 7.3 of the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers, at the request of the interconnection customer, to use operating
assumptions that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource in
the cluster study process and to allow, but not require, transmission providers to:
(1) memorialize the generating facility’s operating assumptions in Appendix H of the
interconnection customer’s LGIA; and/or (2) require control technologies (software
and/or hardware) for an electric storage resource that wishes to limit its operations during
peak load conditions, with such protection devices included in Appendix C of the
interconnection customer’s LGIA.
We adopt the proposed revisions to section 8.2 of the pro forma LGIP to require
transmission providers, at the request of the interconnection customer, to use operating
assumptions that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource in
the interconnection facilities study process.
We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP to
require interconnection customers to provide to the transmission provider as part of the

initial interconnection request: (1) the requested operating assumptions for the
interconnecting electric storage resource; and (2) a description of any applicable control
technologies. However, we agree with MISO and Pine Gate that it is not necessary, and
may not be possible, to specify the specific ancillary services that an electric storage
resource will provide before entering the interconnection queue, particularly because the
market rules addressing the provision of ancillary services from electric storage
resources, whether they are standalone, part of co-located generating facilities, or part of
a hybrid generating facility, are still being developed in multiple markets and such rules
will likely change over the coming years.2860 Therefore, we decline to adopt the proposed
revision to require interconnection customers to list the specific ancillary services they
intend to provide as part of the initial interconnection request.2861 In addition, we agree
with MISO and CAISO that control technologies frequently evolve, and interconnection
customers that choose to specify operating assumptions should be responsible for
including appropriate control technologies with their requests to use such operating
assumptions. Therefore, we also decline to adopt the proposed revision to require
transmission providers to publicly post a list of acceptable control technologies.
We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP to
require interconnection customers to provide to the transmission provider any proposed

initial interconnection request. This timing ensures that the flexibility provided by this
reform does not delay the cluster study process by ensuring the transmission provider has
all necessary information at the time interconnection studies commence. In response to
commenters that request that the Commission define a clear decision point after which
changes to operating assumptions may be considered a material modification,2862 we
reiterate that the operating assumptions must be submitted as part of the initial
interconnection request. Further, we clarify that such operating assumptions only pertain
to the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource, i.e., whether the
interconnecting resource will or will not charge during peak load conditions.
We modify the NOPR proposal to add article 17.2 to the pro forma LGIA to
describe a violation of operating assumptions for generating facilities, including for an
electric storage resource. We also add Appendix H to the pro forma LGIA as the
location for the interconnection customer to memorialize its operating assumptions. If
the owner of the generating facility fails to operate the generating facility in accordance
with its operating assumptions, as memorialized in Appendix H of the pro forma LGIA,
the transmission provider may pursue termination of the LGIA through the breach and
cure provisions found in article 17 of the pro forma LGIA. As already provided for in
article 17 of the pro forma LGIA, we agree with Environmental Defense Fund that
interconnection customers should be given the opportunity to cure a breach of the LGIA

if possible.2863 We clarify that, if an interconnection customer fails to operate its electric
storage resource in accordance with the operating assumptions memorialized in the
interconnection customer’s LGIA, the procedure for termination pursuant to articles
17.1.1 and 17.1.2 of the pro forma LGIA is appropriate. We believe that repeat
violations of the operating assumptions memorialized in the LGIA are likely not
consistent with good utility practice.2864 Additionally, we agree with rPlus and Idaho
Power that there may be unique instances in real-time operations during which a
transmission provider would want an electric storage resource to charge during peak load
conditions (e.g., because the electric storage resource is located in a generation pocket).
Therefore, we clarify that, if done so at the direction of the transmission provider to
maintain the reliable and efficient operation of the transmission system, an electric
storage resource that operates contrary to the operating assumptions specified in its LGIA
in this instance must not be considered in breach of its LGIA by the transmission
provider.
We believe that, taken together, the revisions to the pro forma LGIP and pro

assumptions used to study their electric storage resource and ameliorate concerns about
possible reliability problems expressed by commenters. We agree with commenters that:
(1) control devices can prevent electric storage resources from charging during peak load
conditions; (2) modern electric storage resources can respond to signals from the
transmission provider within seconds; (3) electric storage resources generally do not have
an economic incentive to charge during peak load conditions; and (4) the consequence of
being considered in breach of the LGIA provides an additional incentive for electric
storage resources to follow the agreed-upon operating assumptions memorialized in their
LGIA. Further, we note that some transmission providers already assume in their
interconnection studies that electric storage resources will not charge during peak load
conditions.2865 We emphasize that, irrespective of these changes to operating
assumptions, all electric storage resources must continue to meet all requirements in the
pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA, as well as all applicable reliability standards.
We agree with commenters that the speed and control with which electric storage
resources can respond to signals from transmission providers sufficiently distinguishes
the charging behavior of electric storage resources from that of firm customer end-use
load. Therefore, for purposes of determining any network upgrades necessary to
accommodate the reliable interconnection of electric storage resources, we find that the

charging of electric storage resources should not be modeled equivalently to firm
customer end-use load in interconnection studies if the interconnection customer
memorializes its operating assumptions in the LGIA and installs control technologies, if
required, to limit its operations as specified.
For clarity and in response to MISO’s concern about conflicting descriptions of
the reform in the NOPR preamble and the proposed revisions to the pro forma LGIP, we
modify the proposed revisions to the pro forma LGIP to clarify that these requirements
apply only to the operating assumptions for withdrawals of energy (e.g., proposed
charging behavior of electric storage resources, whether standalone, co-located
generating facilities, or part of a hybrid generating facility), not to discharging.
In response to Pine Gate’s request for clarification about what network upgrade
costs will be allocated to interconnection customers as a result of the adoption of the
revisions related to operating assumptions, we clarify that the transmission provider must
not assign network upgrade costs to the interconnection customer based on those worstcase operating assumptions (e.g., charging at maximum capacity during peak load
conditions) where there is agreement from the interconnection customer to, if required,
implement operating restrictions including installing or demonstrating that the generating
facility already has control technologies (software and/or hardware) to limit its operations
during peak load conditions. As addressed above, we believe that these conditions
sufficiently address any reliability concerns associated with the unexpected operation of
an electric storage resource and thus believe it is appropriate for the transmission

provider to only assign costs for network upgrades based on the proposed charging
behavior of the electric storage resource.2866
Several commenters point out that not all transmission providers use the same
process to study the charging of electric storage resources. Some transmission providers
determine the network upgrades needed to accommodate the charging of an electric
storage resource in the interconnection process, whereas other transmission providers do
so exclusively as part of a transmission service request.2867 In response to these
commenters, we clarify that the requirement for transmission providers to use operating
assumptions, at the request of the interconnection customer, in interconnection studies
that reflect the proposed charging behavior of an electric storage resource applies only to
the operating assumptions that transmission providers use in the interconnection process.
This requirement does not apply to transmission service requests and this final rule does
not propose to modify the process for requesting transmission service. In response to
Puget Sound,2868 we further clarify that this reform does not require transmission
providers to study charging as part of the interconnection process if they do not already

do so. If a transmission provider does not determine the network upgrades needed to
accommodate the charging of an electric storage resource through the interconnection
process, then on compliance the transmission provider must demonstrate why this reform
does not apply to that particular transmission provider.
In the NOPR, the Commission sought comment on whether to define “peak load
period” and/or “net peak load” period.2869 Given the variation in the scenarios that
transmission providers study in the interconnection process (e.g., summer peak load,
winter peak load, shoulder peak load, light load conditions, etc.), we agree with
commenters that regional flexibility is warranted.2870 Therefore, we decline to adopt
standardized definitions of “peak load period” and/or “net peak load” period.
In the NOPR, the Commission also sought comment on whether to define firm and
non-firm charging for electric storage resources and require transmission providers to
define study criteria and possible ways to interconnect related to both firm and non-firm
charging.2871 Further, the Commission sought comment on proposed definitions of firm
and non-firm charging service. Several commenters express concerns about defining
firm and non-firm charging service, including whether the proposed definitions conflate
interconnection and transmission service. We believe that, given the other reforms

adopted herein regarding operating assumptions, the proposed definitions of firm and
non-firm charging service are not necessary to ensure that transmission providers, at the
request of the interconnection customer, use more realistic operating assumptions to
study electric storage resources in the interconnection process and to avoid excessive and
unnecessary network upgrades that may otherwise hinder the timely development of new
electric storage resources. Therefore, we decline to adopt any definitions of firm and
non-firm charging service. As a result, we also clarify that this final rule does not require
transmission providers to define conditions under which electric storage resources will be
curtailed. In response to CAISO’s concern that a proposed definition of firm charging
service would require transmission providers that do not currently provide firm charging
service to do so, we clarify that this final rule does not require transmission providers to
provide firm charging service.
In the NOPR, the Commission sought comment on whether to expand this reform
to address operating assumptions for additional generating facility technologies that may
currently be inaccurately modeled, such as variable energy resources.2872 The
Commission also sought comment on whether other operating assumptions, in addition to
the assumption that electric storage resources withdraw energy during peak load periods,
should be addressed as part of this proposed reform. In response to several commenters’
concerns about potential reliability impacts and the administrative burden of extending
the NOPR proposal to also address injections of power from electric storage resources or

other resource types, we decline in this final rule to extend the reform to apply to
additional generating facility technologies or to other operating assumptions. We clarify
that this reform does not apply to the operating assumptions used to study the injection of
power from electric storage resources or the injection of power from other resource types
(e.g., natural gas, solar, wind, etc.). We encourage transmission providers to examine on
an individual basis what operating assumptions used to study the injection of power may
be appropriate to render the study process more accurate. Similarly, we decline to require
transmission providers to use fuel-based dispatch assumptions to study the injection of
power from all resource types in interconnection studies at this time, as suggested by
some commenters. We acknowledge that fuel-based dispatch assumptions may be able to
address some of the identified challenges associated with inaccurate modeling
assumptions for all resource types and encourage transmission providers to evaluate the
merits of adopting it, but we do not believe that adopting such a requirement on a generic
basis is supported by the record.
We decline to address the potential implications of this reform for transmission
providers with Commission-approved interconnection processes that vary from the pro
forma requirements adopted in Order Nos. 2003 and 845. As explained in the Section IV
of this final rule, transmission providers with such variations from the pro forma LGIP
and pro forma LGIA may seek approval as part of the compliance process to maintain
those variations, which the Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis. What we
adopt in this final rule are requirements that are part of the pro forma LGIP and pro
forma LGIA, and we therefore only address the interaction of the requirements adopted

herein with existing requirements that are part of the pro forma process and not variations
thereto.
We also decline to require transmission providers to use standardized operating
assumptions, as some commenters suggest.2873 In the NOPR, the Commission did not
propose to require transmission providers to use standardized operating assumptions, and
we decline to do so here.
In response to comments from Hydropower Commenters’ suggestion that the final
rule include a simplified procedure for amending an executed interconnection agreement
to optimize the operating parameters of a pumped storage plant already in operation,2874
we find that such a request is outside the scope of this proceeding. In the NOPR, the
Commission did not propose a new study process for resources already in operation to
amend operating assumptions memorialized in their interconnection agreements.
In response to Microgrid Resources’ request that the Commission explicitly
include microgrids in the provisions of this rulemaking applied to hybrid resources,2875
we find such a request to be outside the scope of this proceeding. The Commission did
not propose to define microgrids or apply specific reforms to microgrids in the NOPR,
and we decline to do so now. Further, in response to Microgrid Resources’ and IREC’s
requests that the Commission extend the proposed reforms for hybrid resources to the pro

Transmission Technologies in Interconnection Studies
Upon Request of the Interconnection Customer
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission stated that alternative transmission technologies
can provide substantial benefits to optimize the transmission system in specific scenarios
because they often can be deployed both more quickly and at lower costs than other
network upgrades.2877 The Commission stated that, despite these potential benefits,
alternative transmission technologies often do not receive the same consideration during
generator interconnection processes as other network upgrades.2878 The Commission
preliminarily found that failing to consider alternative transmission technologies that can
be deployed both more quickly and at lower costs than network upgrades may render
Commission-jurisdictional rates unjust and unreasonable.

The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP to
require transmission providers, upon request of the interconnection customer, to evaluate
the requested alternative transmission solution(s) during the pro forma LGIP cluster
study and the pro forma SGIP system impact study and facilities study within the
generator interconnection process.2879
To provide more certainty for evaluation purposes, and focus on technologies that
serve a transmission function and thus are subject to Commission jurisdiction, the
Commission proposed to specify the technologies that the interconnection customer may
request to be evaluated.2880 Specifically, the Commission proposed revisions to the pro
forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP to require transmission providers to consider the
following technologies within the cluster study of the pro forma LGIP and within the
system impact study and facilities study of the pro forma SGIP upon request of the
interconnection customer: advanced power flow control, transmission switching,
dynamic line ratings, static synchronous compensators, and static VAR compensators.
The Commission stated that it believes that the deployment of these transmission
technologies may reduce interconnection costs by providing lower cost network upgrades
to interconnect new generating facilities.2881

The Commission explained that, under this proposal, the interconnection customer
may request, at the relevant scoping meeting, that the transmission provider consider a
single, multiple, or all technologies on this list.2882 The Commission proposed that the
transmission provider would be required to evaluate the transmission technologies
identified above for feasibility, cost, and time savings within the cluster study for the pro
forma LGIP and the system impact study and facilities study for the pro forma SGIP,
upon request of the interconnection customer. The Commission explained that the
transmission provider, upon this request, must evaluate the identified transmission
technology and, if feasible, determine whether it should be used, consistent with good
utility practice and other applicable regulatory standards. Transmission providers would
continue to retain discretion regarding whether to use the transmission technology.
The Commission sought comment on whether the list of alternative transmission
technologies is sufficient.2883 In particular, the Commission sought comment on whether
storage that performs a transmission function, synchronous condensers, and voltage
source converters should be included in the list of alternative transmission technologies.
The Commission also sought comment on: (1) whether there are software, operational,
or other barriers to the use of these transmission technologies as proposed; (2) whether
the use of alternative transmission technologies as supplements for, or in the place of,
traditional network upgrades is sufficient to guarantee a level of service to accommodate

be used if the interconnection customer requested ERIS; (3) whether the existing study
processes and models in the generator interconnection process remain suitable for
considering alternative transmission technologies, whether additional processes or
models are needed, and if so, which entity should be responsible for developing them;
(4) how costs incurred for evaluating alternative transmission technology study requests
would be allocated among interconnection customers in the cluster; (5) what reasonable
number of transmission technology study requests from each interconnection customer
would be workable, the burden (in terms of both time and resources) on transmission
providers required to evaluate such requests, and whether interconnection study deadlines
may need to be extended to account for time needed to evaluate the alternative
transmission technology study requests; and (6) whether provisional interconnection
service consideration for transmission technologies should be mandatory.2884

alternative transmission technologies in the NOPR can reduce costs.2886 With respect to
reducing interconnection costs, SEIA contends that, by decreasing the costs of network
upgrades, the proposal will reduce the number of withdrawals from the interconnection
queue, creating a more stable and efficient interconnection process.2887 SEIA also claims
that decreasing these costs will reduce the interconnection costs for interconnection
customers, who may then reflect those savings in power purchase agreements or
integrated resource plan submissions.2888 Commenters contend that, if the Commission
were to not adopt this proposal, the failure to lower interconnection costs by evaluating
alternative transmission technologies would impose unjust and unreasonable costs on
interconnection customers.2889

With respect to reducing interconnection delays, Illinois Commission asserts, for
example, that alternative transmission technologies allow resources to come online more
quickly and allow for better use of the existing transmission system, requiring fewer
transmission buildouts.2890 OMS contends that failing to consider alternative
transmission technologies risks requiring longer lead-time network upgrades.2891 WATT
Coalition argues that use of the appropriate technologies will result in fewer withdrawals
from the interconnection queue and a reduction in restudies and delays.2892 WATT
Coalition points out that, when interconnection customers withdraw, grid enhancing
technologies offer additional value because they are scalable and modular to address
evolving needs and can be redeployed as those needs continue to change.2893
With respect to reliability, Ohio Commission Consumer Advocate contends that
some alternative transmission technologies could provide substantial benefits by
resolving thermal overloads and avoiding voltage collapse.2894

Some commenters argue that a requirement to study alternative transmission
technologies would not slow down interconnection studies overall.2895 For example, AEE
states that, if a technology is not proven or commercially viable, it will be quickly ruled
out of further evaluation under prevailing study approaches.2896 ACORE claims that an
evaluation of alternative transmission technologies would not be a burden but rather an
integral part of interconnection studies because such an evaluation will likely reduce the
number of withdrawals and restudies.2897 WATT Coalition argues that, because
transmission providers currently use an iterative process when conducting
interconnection studies, adding the proposed list of alternative transmission technologies
to an iterative solution set should not significantly change the time frame or complexity
of studies.2898

assessment of alternative transmission technologies such as static VAR compensators as
needed in interconnection studies.2900 AEE responds that, if alternative transmission
technologies are already being evaluated, then the proposal will not place an additional
burden on interconnection queues.2901
Several commenters oppose the proposal because they believe it conflates the use
of alternative transmission technologies in operations with their use in planning.2902 For
instance, MISO argues that alternative transmission technologies are not necessarily the
solution needed for any particular interconnection because these are often operational
solutions that are inappropriate for wide-scale deployment in a planning process, which
reviews an entire cycle of proposed interconnections and identifies solutions to support
those interconnections for the expected lifetime of their interconnection.2903 MISO
claims that using alternative transmission technologies in planning for interconnection
rather than in operations may be inconsistent with “good utility practice” and “applicable
regulatory standards”, and MISO expresses concerns about the impact or effectiveness of
using alternative transmission technologies in place of network upgrades.2904 NYTOs

assert that alternative transmission technologies should generally not be used in
interconnection studies unless they are effective in the planning context.2905 PJM argues
that alternative transmission technologies should not be incorporated into the generator
interconnection process because they do not represent long-term solutions that can serve
as blanket substitutes for the need for transmission expansion.2906 In response, AEE and
WATT Coalition argue that the primary purpose of alternative transmission technologies
is to serve as a complementary bridge technology while more robust transmission is
built.2907
Some commenters express concern that alternative transmission technologies are
not always appropriate for addressing long-term, interconnection-related reliability
issues.2908 Southern adds that, because transmission providers already consider these
technologies and are subject to mandatory reliability standards, interconnection
customers should not be able to request certain reliability fixes because their overall
focus may be to minimize cost instead of maximizing reliability.2909 EEI asserts that

building firm transmission capacity or replacing or upgrading limiting equipment
provides a more reliable long-term solution than the use of alternative transmission

requirements related to alternative transmission technologies in this proceeding while
other Commission proceedings meant to address the use of these same technologies are
pending.2912 ACORE responds that, given the benefits of incorporating alternative
transmission technologies in interconnection studies, there is no justification for delaying
this requirement pending action in the other Commission proceedings.2913

concerning alternative transmission technologies, given the sweeping changes proposed

MISO contends that some alternative transmission technologies, e.g., technologies
that can control line impedances, may shift the burden of system impacts to other parties
by causing additional new constraints.2916 Indicated PJM TOs are concerned that, if one
interconnection customer request changes power flows, such as through the use of phase

requests” are avoided.2918
Several commenters argue that the NOPR proposal is overly burdensome for
transmission providers.2919 For instance, MISO TOs note the competing interests (i.e.,
accelerating the interconnection process and layering numerous additional requirements
and significantly increasing the number of studies an RTO/ISO and its transmission
owners must perform).2920 MISO argues that the Commission’s proposal would require
MISO to conduct 4,780 evaluations in the first phase of its interconnection study
process.2921 MISO contends that, when evaluating how these technologies can be
incorporated, the effects on the rest of the interconnection queue and system can generate
debate that could slow down the interconnection process. Similarly, National Grid claims
that new alternative transmission technologies can present modeling uncertainties (e.g.,
operating parameters and cost uncertainties) and potential software limitations that
transmission owners would need an unforeseeable amount of time to evaluate and could
lead to possible penalties if study deadlines are not met.2922

List of Alternative Transmission
Technologies

Some commenters broadly support the list of proposed alternative transmission
technologies,2923 with others supporting particular technologies (e.g., dynamic line
ratings2924 and advanced power flow control2925).
MISO and SoCal Edison oppose the proposed list of technologies because they
contend that it includes technologies that are not appropriate for interconnection.2926
MISO asserts that, although the deployment of devices such as static series synchronous
compensators could solve some problems, they could create other issues (e.g., a change
to the impedance of any one transmission facility could cause problems or impact
operations elsewhere), requiring the holistic management of their operation and
deployment.2927 SoCal Edison claims that certain technologies that the interconnection

customer may request to be evaluated, such as dynamic line ratings, have not been fully
tested by certain RTOs/ISOs and thus should be excluded from the permissible list of
options requested by an interconnection customer.2928
Some commenters assert that, although dynamic line ratings may be beneficial
during operations, they may not be appropriate for interconnection or transmission
planning.2929 Others note several operational challenges of using dynamic line ratings in
interconnection, such as: (1) there is currently no Commission or NERC guidance on
how to use dynamic line ratings absent thorough data on wind conditions, temperature,
and other future system conditions;2930 and (2) interconnection study software is not
capable of incorporating dynamic line ratings, and it is not clear what assumptions should
be used on affected systems.2931 ISO-NE argues that the Commission should continue to
consider the use and implementation of this technology in Docket No. AD22-5, rather
than here.2932 In response, WATT Coalition argues that there is significant value in
considering dynamic line ratings in planning, adding that dynamic line ratings and other

grid enhancing technologies are not more difficult to study than legacy devices and
traditional solutions.2933
While acknowledging the benefits that advanced power flow control devices
provide for real-time operations, Indicated PJM TOs contend that they are inappropriate
in the context of implementing solutions to facilitate interconnection.2934 Tri-State claims
that advanced power flow control devices may push power onto other affected systems,
which is a more significant challenge in non-RTO/ISO scenarios.2935 MISO asserts that
the widespread use of advanced flow control devices can have widespread impacts due to
sizeable adjustments to line impedances and that using these devices could result in a
cascade of issues across the system, pushing the problem and the costs of remedying it to
other customers.2936 WATT Coalition asserts that automatic power factor controllers are
just as effective at mitigating overloads as reconductoring but that automatic power factor

devices as potential alternatives to standard system infrastructure.2938
Some commenters raise concerns about using transmission switching for
interconnection. For instance, Tri-State questions whether transmission switching is
meant to be a remedial action scheme or to create permanent open points on the system,
which it argues may be problematic in non-RTOs/ISOs and may result in reduced
reliability on the transmission system.2939 MISO argues that applying automatic topology
changes would be remedial action schemes, noting that MISO and its transmission
owners have attempted to reduce the number of remedial action schemes employed on
the system as a matter of good utility practice.2940 PacifiCorp contends that transmission
switching is a complex process that can be implemented only under particular factual
scenarios and system conditions, adding that it is unlikely that system congestion could
be reliably reduced by requiring the analysis of transmission switching in the study
process.2941
Other commenters argue that the Commission should not limit the alternative
transmission technologies to a pre-approved list.2942 Some commenters contend that the

Commission’s proposal could limit future grid enhancing technologies that might be the
best solution because the list includes only five technologies and would not require
transmission providers to consider new grid enhancing technologies until the list is
expanded.2943 AEE and ENGIE ask the Commission to provide a non-exhaustive list of
alternative transmission technologies and allow any alternative transmission technologies
or grid enhancing technologies that are proven and commercially viable to qualify for
evaluation, consistent with the Commission’s statutory obligation to “encourage, as
appropriate, the deployment of advanced transmission technologies” and the list of
alternative transmission technologies included in that statute.2944

condensers and voltage source converters;2945 (2) IBR technology solutions for advanced

Several commenters also suggest adding advanced conductors to the required list
of alternative transmission technologies.2949 VEIR and ACORE argue that advanced
conductors may be a beneficial alternative to network upgrades because: (1) advanced
conductors meet the same criteria of quick deployment and low cost and have advantages
over other network upgrades, especially the elimination of additional siting and
permitting requirements;2950 and (2) a recent Grid Strategies LLC report finds “short lead
time to reconductor existing lines can help manage risk and uncertainties and
significantly increase system capacity to mitigate overloads identified in interconnection
studies.”2951 NARUC asks the Commission to consider requiring an evaluation of the
accuracy of transmission line ratings on surrounding or impacted transmission facilities if

performs a transmission function can relieve congestion, maintain reliability, and be
placed on the transmission system more quickly and cheaply than building new
transmission lines.2955 Tesla suggests expanding the list to include batteries as virtual
transmission, arguing that it provides several benefits (e.g., providing emergency capacity
for congested transmission lines and surplus generation and surplus load capacity to
allow operation of transmission lines closer to thermal capacity without risk of outage
and averting the need for load shed by providing grid stability service).2956 Clean Energy

prohibit an interconnection customer from adding electric storage to an interconnection
request specifically to address transmission reliability impacts in lieu of conventional
upgrades, while at the same time allowing an interconnection customer to add such
storage to an interconnection request for purposes unrelated to transmission reliability or
allowing an interconnection customer to limit electric storage operations as a means to
avoid network upgrades.2957
Other commenters do not agree with adding storage that performs a transmission
function to the list.2958 MISO notes that, although it already evaluates storage that
performs a transmission function in its generator interconnection process, it was a subject
of considerable debate.2959 Shell states that, while storage that performs a transmission
function may provide system benefits, it has concerns regarding the ability of storage that
performs a transmission function to “queue jump” interconnection customers, thus
putting those customers at a competitive disadvantage.2960

Whether to Mandate the
Consideration of Alternative
Transmission Technologies

Several commenters argue that these technologies should be studied by default,
rather than at the request of the interconnection customer, with some suggesting an “optout” that the interconnection customer could elect.2961 Fervo Energy argues that
mandating the consideration of grid enhancing technologies could be more efficient and
facilitate more and faster interconnection, although there may be delays initially as
transmission providers adjust.2962 Clean Energy Associations ask that transmission
providers automatically evaluate grid enhancing technologies, unless all interconnection
customers in a cluster opt out.2963 Ørsted recommends that the Commission consider
requiring that advanced transmission technologies be studied and implemented when
network upgrades are needed but cannot be completed within three years of being
identified.2964

CAISO contends that the Commission should simply require transmission
providers to include a statement in their tariffs that they will consider alternative
transmission technologies for every interconnection and incorporate them when they are
the cost-effective solution.2965 CAISO states that this would allow the interconnection
customer to request an unexecuted interconnection agreement and to raise with the
Commission any transmission provider refusal to consider a technology.2966 Ohio
Commission Consumer Advocate suggests that transmission providers and
interconnection customers mutually determine an appropriate number of evaluations for
grid enhancing technologies.2967

Alternative Transmission
Technologies in Provisional
Interconnection Service

Some commenters argue that alternative transmission technologies could assist
with provisional interconnection service. For instance, R Street and Hannon Armstrong
assert that these technologies can be used as a temporary measure until other network
upgrades are completed, thus reducing the cost and delays of generator interconnection,
even if they only serve as a bridge to a permanent solution set, such as cluster network
upgrades.2968 NextEra contends that, when an alternative transmission technology may

serve as a temporary solution, the transmission provider should reasonably cooperate
with requests from an interconnection customer willing to fund installation of that
technology as an interim solution.2969 Fervo Energy asks the Commission to require
transmission providers to consider alternative transmission technologies when responding
to a provisional interconnection request if these technologies allow for earlier in-service
dates.2970
Others oppose requiring evaluation of alternative transmission technologies for
provisional interconnection service.2971 For instance, MISO argues that the consideration
of advanced transmission technologies for provisional interconnection service should not
be mandatory because it may result in delays that are contrary to the goals of this
proceeding.2972

Alternative Transmission
Technologies for NRIS or ERIS

Some commenters responded to whether the use of alternative transmission
technologies can support an interconnection customer’s request for NRIS, or whether the
use of such technologies can only be used if the interconnection customer requested
ERIS. Hannon Armstrong asserts that one or more of these alternative transmission

technologies may be able to delay or eliminate the needed network upgrades identified in
interconnection studies under both ERIS and NRIS.2973 MISO argues that technologies
that merely curtail generation would not be suitable for interconnection requests seeking
NRIS as they could not pass the deliverability test, while technologies that can control
transmission line impedances, such as phase shifters, are acceptable for NRIS.2974
Invenergy contends that a given alternative transmission technology may only facilitate
ERIS service in certain circumstances but that there is no reason to limit the scope of
alternative transmission technologies at the outset without having performed any relevant
analysis.2975 Clean Energy Associations ask the Commission to require transmission
providers to publicly post any service differences (e.g., if use of a given technology
would enable ERIS but not necessarily NRIS).2976

Study and Network Upgrade Cost
Allocation for Alternative
Transmission Technologies

Commenters address the Commission’s question about how costs incurred for
evaluating alternative transmission technology study requests would be allocated among
interconnection customers in the cluster. WATT Coalition argues that any marginal
increase of study costs to accommodate the evaluation of grid enhancing technologies

should be allocated evenly across interconnection customer cluster study participants.2977
However, NARUC and Indicated PJM TOs disagree, asserting that additional costs
incurred for evaluating alternative transmission technologies should be allocated to the
requesting interconnection customer(s) to maintain cost certainty and equity.2978 Fervo
Energy proposes that, if the requested alternative transmission technology would benefit
more than one interconnection customer in the cluster, a pro rata allocation of study cost
among those interconnection customers would be appropriate; however, if the requested
technology only serves one interconnection customer, Fervo Energy argues that direct
cost allocation for that study cost is appropriate.2979 Fervo Energy adds that it would
support pro rata allocation of costs even if the Commission mandates consideration of
alternative transmission technologies.2980
NextEra argues that, under the “but for” principle of cost allocation, the
interconnection customer’s cost responsibility should be limited to the cost of the
alternative transmission technology that would have sufficed as a long-term solution for a
given network upgrade, especially when transmission providers choose instead to
construct more costly upgrades beyond what is required for the interconnection

interconnection customer to fund costly network upgrades when it would be more
equitable for the interconnection customers to share the cost of a single network
upgrade.2982

Timing of Alternative Transmission
Technology Evaluation Requests

Some commenters discuss limiting the request to include alternative transmission
technologies to the initial stages of the interconnection process. ISO-NE and NESCOE
argue that any alternatives that are proposed should be included in the initial
interconnection request with specific assumptions that can be studied.2983
Other commenters argue that interconnection customers should be able to request
the study of alternative transmission technologies later in the interconnection process or
when more information is available.2984 Clean Energy Associations contend that

studies are done, and if the required upgrades are outside of the cluster area, then
alternate transmission technologies, with the addition of energy storage, should be
evaluated by the transmission provider during its system impact study phase.2986
NARUC asks the Commission to ensure that there is an opportunity for
information exchange between the transmission provider and interconnection customer to
design alternative transmission technology solutions and supports implementation of a
time frame to facilitate that information exchange.2987 Ohio Commission Consumer
Advocate contends that some changes would be required to address unique attributes of
grid enhancing technologies that may be overlooked by existing frameworks and that the
cost and duration of modeling and evaluations would be best addressed by transmission
providers in concert with interconnection customers.2988

Requests for Clarification and Flexibility

Ameren asks how software or operational barriers (such as whether the MISO
software can model the technology) will be addressed.2989 Ameren asks for clarification
as to who pays for the software necessary to model the alternative transmission
technology and whether that gets assigned to the interconnection customer requesting the
use of the advanced transmission technology or to the cluster of interconnection
customers, some of which may prefer a different solution that does not involve use of an
advanced transmission technology. Ameren claims that it is unclear what happens if
interconnection customers within the same cluster disagree about using an alternative
transmission technology in place of a network upgrade and whether consensus is
required.
NARUC suggests that the Commission clarify that transmission providers need
not perform a separate study for each requested alternative transmission technology.2990
NARUC also asks the Commission to clarify that interconnection customers bear the
burden of designing the alternative transmission technology solutions, preparing
necessary technical data, and determining whether it is temporary or permanent.
NEPOOL urges the Commission to receive input from each RTO/ISO to consider
how much flexibility to provide with respect to the list of alternative transmission
technologies because they are the most informed with respect to which alternative

transmission technologies are feasible.2991 Similarly, NYTOs ask the Commission to
allow regions to determine which alternative transmission technologies would be
appropriate and beneficial in performing interconnection studies instead of mandating
their use.2992
Some commenters underscore the importance of transmission providers retaining
the discretion to decline to adopt an alternative transmission technology in the place of a
network upgrade.2993 National Grid argues that, to the extent an interconnection customer
requests evaluation of a new alternative transmission technology beyond the list proposed
in the NOPR and provides studies in support of its proposed use, the transmission owner
should be permitted to determine whether the evaluation of such a new technology will
be beneficial.2994 Indicated PJM TOs request that, if the final rule requires transmission
providers to consider alternative transmission technologies, the transmission provider and
transmission owners have the ability to reject the request without a study when they have
knowledge or experience that the request will not work.2995

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modifications, the proposed revisions to section 7.3 of the pro
forma LGIP, and sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.10 of the pro forma SGIP. We modify the NOPR
proposal to require transmission providers to evaluate the following enumerated list of
alternative transmission technologies: static synchronous compensators, static VAR
compensators, advanced power flow control devices, transmission switching, synchronous
condensers, voltage source converters, advanced conductors, and tower lifting. We
modify proposed pro forma LGIP section 7.3 to require transmission providers to evaluate
the list of alternative transmission technologies enumerated in this final rule during the
cluster study, including any restudies, of the generator interconnection process in all
instances (i.e., for all interconnection customers in a cluster), without the need for a

request from an interconnection customer. We require transmission providers to evaluate
each alternative transmission technology listed in pro forma LGIP section 7.3 and to
determine, in the transmission provider’s sole discretion, whether it should be used,
consistent with good utility practice, applicable reliability standards, and other applicable
regulatory requirements. Finally, we require transmission providers to include, in the
pro forma LGIP cluster study report, an explanation of the results of the evaluation of the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies for feasibility, cost, and time savings as
an alternative to a traditional network upgrade.
We modify the enumerated list of alternative transmission technologies from the
NOPR proposal to: (1) retain synchronous, static VAR compensators, advanced power
flower control, and transmission switching in the list; (2) add synchronous condensers,
voltage source converters, advanced conductors, and tower lifting to the list; and
(3) remove dynamic line ratings from the list. Generally, we find that these enumerated
alternative transmission technologies are those with the most potential to be useful to
reduce interconnection costs by providing lower cost network upgrades to interconnect
new generating facilities and, thus, we require transmission providers to evaluate these
technologies in the interconnection process for their feasibility, cost, and time savings
potential.
We also adopt, with modifications, the proposed revisions to sections 3.3.6 and
3.4.10 of the pro forma SGIP. Consistent with the pro forma LGIP requirement, we
require transmission providers to evaluate the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies in all instances, without the need for a request from an interconnection

customer. We modify the proposal to require such evaluations to occur during the
pro forma SGIP feasibility study and system impact study of the generator
interconnection process, as opposed to in the pro forma SGIP system impact study and
facilities study. We find that it is appropriate to modify the proposal so that these
evaluations occur during the relevant pro forma SGIP studies where network upgrades
are identified, consistent with the pro forma LGIP requirement. We require transmission
providers to evaluate each alternative transmission technology listed in pro forma SGIP
sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.10 and determine, in the transmission provider’s sole discretion,
whether it should be used, consistent with good utility practice, applicable reliability
standards, and other applicable regulatory requirements.
Finally, we require transmission providers to include, in the feasibility study report
and system impact study report, an explanation of the results of the evaluation of the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies for feasibility, cost, and time savings as
an alternative to a traditional network upgrade. We note that this reform is one of the few
reforms in this final rule that applies to small generating facilities, in addition to large
generating facilities. As described below, we find that the enumerated alternative
transmission technologies that we are requiring transmission providers to evaluate in their
interconnection studies are appropriate for evaluation in the pro forma SGIP context
because they are scalable, and we find that the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies have the potential to provide similar benefits in the context of both small
and large generating facilities, including cost and time savings. As such, we adopt, with
modifications, the proposed revisions to require transmission providers to evaluate the

enumerated alternative transmission technologies in all instances in both the pro forma
LGIP and pro forma SGIP.
This final rule does not create a presumption in favor of substituting alternative
transmission technologies for necessary traditional network upgrades, either categorically
or in specific cases.3002 This final rule is agnostic as to whether, in a specific case, an
alternative transmission technology is an acceptable alternative to a traditional network
upgrade,3003 “that would allow the interconnection customer to flow the output of its
generating facility onto the transmission provider’s transmission system in a safe and

However, as stated above,3015 this final rule mandates a process of evaluation of
alternative transmission technologies, not outcomes in specific cases, and does not create
a presumption in favor of using an alternative transmission technology as a substitute for
a traditional network upgrade deemed necessary in a specific case. Rather, under the
approach adopted here, in all cases, the transmission provider is required only to evaluate
the use of alternative transmission technologies as network upgrades consistent with good
utility practice, applicable reliability standards, and other applicable regulatory
requirements.3016 We recognize that, after the transmission provider evaluates the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies, the transmission provider, in its sole
discretion, may still decide to remedy an identified reliability problem with a traditional
network upgrade.
We modify the proposed requirement that transmission providers evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies only at the request of the
interconnection customer. Instead, we require transmission providers to evaluate the

process and avoids introducing additional procedural complexity to the interconnection
process. This approach, which was suggested by many commenters,3017 will provide the
benefits of an evaluation of the enumerated alternative transmission technologies more
broadly and consistently and in a more efficient manner. We believe that modifying the

specifically, evaluating alternative transmission technologies only by request, as
proposed in the NOPR, would create an overly complicated and time-consuming process
under which transmission providers evaluate each alternative transmission technology for
each interconnection request individually. Commenters also raise concerns about the
impact on costs and timing for the entire cluster if only a portion of the cluster requests
evaluation of alternative transmission technologies or if interconnection customers within

these concerns, and the potential for benefits to be gained by the evaluation and use, at
the transmission provider’s sole discretion, of the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies, we find that it would be overly burdensome and complex to require
transmission providers to track and process interconnection customer-specific study
requests and to resolve conflicts between interconnection customers’ different study
requests, at the expense of those benefits.
The record before us demonstrates that the requirements we adopt today will not
overly burden transmission providers.3020 We find that requiring transmission providers
to evaluate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies in each interconnection
study will not be a significant additional burden on interconnection queues for those
transmission providers that already consider alternative transmission technologies in their
interconnection process. Furthermore, we find that the benefits of evaluating and
implementing the enumerated alternative transmission technologies outweigh the
potential burden or the potential of increased study times. As recognized by commenters
and explained above, the evaluation and use, at the transmission provider’s sole
discretion, of the enumerated alternative transmission technologies could decrease
network upgrade costs, withdrawals, and restudies, thereby increasing the efficiency of
the interconnection process overall. For these reasons, we disagree with commenters that
argue that requiring transmission providers to evaluate the enumerated alternative

interconnection queue processing.
We find that, in conducting an evaluation of the enumerated alternative
transmission technologies, it is appropriate for transmission providers to continue to
retain discretion regarding whether to use each enumerated alternative transmission
technology, consistent with the NOPR.3021 The requirement is to evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies in the interconnection process for
feasibility, cost, and time savings and to determine whether, in the transmission
provider’s sole discretion, an alternative transmission technology should be used as a
solution — consistent with good utility practice, applicable reliability standards, and
other applicable regulatory requirements.3022 The transmission provider must determine
whether using any of the enumerated alternative transmission technologies is an
appropriate and reliable network upgrade “that would allow the interconnection customer
to flow the output of its generating facility onto the transmission provider's transmission
system in a safe and reliable manner.”3023 The requirement to make such a determination

addresses concerns that their use may impinge on reliability, delay network upgrades
instead of reducing the need for them or obviating the need for them altogether, or fail to
address all transmission system issues that a traditional network upgrade would address.
We recognize the need to avoid time-consuming delays and costly disputes or litigation
over interconnection costs that could arise as a result of this reform.3024 Therefore, we
find that, if a transmission provider evaluates the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies as required herein and, in its sole discretion, determines not to use any
enumerated alternative transmission technologies as an alternative to a traditional
network upgrade, the transmission provider has complied with this final rule, including
tariffs filed pursuant to this final rule..

that the final rule will not “effectively require a whole additional set of studies for large
areas of the transmission system” or exponentially increase the number of studies needed
to consider the various combinations, as Indicated PJM TOs argue could occur under the
NOPR proposal.3025 This is because transmission providers will not be evaluating the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies for a subset of interconnection
customers within a cluster - but rather for the entire cluster.
Regarding WATT Coalition and California Public Utility Commissioner Darcie
Houck’s request that transmission providers abide by strict standards when studying
alternative transmission technologies,3026 we decline to adopt any such standards in the
pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP governing the evaluation of alternative transmission
technologies. We find that it is appropriate to continue to rely on transmission providers
to use good utility practice, applicable reliability standards, and other applicable
regulatory requirements, in their evaluations of alternative transmission technologies,
including the enumerated list, because the specific evaluation may depend on the
transmission provider’s individual transmission system, cluster makeup, and other
factors. Similarly, regarding National Grid’s concern that studying every potential

transmission providers to be penalized for not meeting study deadlines,3027 the final rule
does not require the study of all technologies considered alternative transmission
technologies but rather the evaluation of the enumerated alternative transmission
technologies. Further, we find that the transmission provider— consistent with good
utility practice, applicable reliability standards, and other applicable regulatory
requirements — retains the sole discretion to determine whether a particular technology
in the enumerated list of alternative transmission technologies is appropriate and reliable
as a network upgrade, or not, for a given cluster.
We also believe that the requirement that transmission providers evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies for an entire cluster—rather than on an
individual interconnection customer-request basis—and the modifications to the
enumerated list of alternative transmission technologies (as discussed below) will ease
the burden on transmission providers, thereby lessening the risk that they are unable to
complete studies by the required deadlines. We note that we are not dictating how a
transmission provider must evaluate each enumerated alternative transmission technology
on the list in each instance; we recognize that in some cases transmission providers may
be able to rapidly determine if a certain enumerated alternative transmission technology
is inappropriate for further study. In response to Invenergy’s request that transmission
providers should provide detailed evaluation reports on why an alternative transmission
technology was not selected, transmission providers are required to include an

explanation of the results of the evaluation of the required alternative transmission
technologies for feasibility, cost, and time savings as an alternative to a traditional
network upgrade in the applicable study report. However, we do not direct any additional
detailed requirements related to this reporting requirement because we find they are not
needed or appropriate. We find the required explanation of the results of the transmission
provider’s evaluation included in the applicable study report provides sufficient
transparency without placing a further burden on transmission providers that would delay
the processing of interconnection requests.
Because we modify the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
evaluate all the enumerated alternative transmission technologies in all instances, i.e.,
regardless of an interconnection customer requesting such an evaluation, we decline to
adopt commenters’ request to require transmission providers to evaluate the required
alternative transmission technologies by default with an “opt-out” option for
interconnection customers. We are not persuaded that there are benefits to including an
“opt-out” option in the requirement, and we find it would be overly burdensome and
complex to require transmission providers to track and process interconnection
customers’ requests to “opt-out” of the evaluation of certain alternative transmission
technologies. Further, an “opt-out” would run contrary to our goal to have transmission
providers evaluate the enumerated technologies in order to achieve beneficial outcomes
like decreasing network upgrade costs, withdrawals, and restudies, thereby increasing the
efficiency of the interconnection process overall.

As discussed above, the enumerated alternative transmission technologies that
transmission providers must evaluate in interconnection studies are: static synchronous
compensators, static VAR compensators, synchronous condensers, advanced power flow
control, transmission switching, voltage source converters, advanced conductors, and
tower lifting. We discuss each technology in turn.
Regarding synchronous and static VAR compensators, we find that, in providing
reactive power to the transmission system, such devices could reduce interconnection
costs by providing the voltage support where needed for the new generation facility being
interconnected to operate reliably, rather than building a traditional network upgrade to
resolve the voltage support issues. This potentially results in lower cost network
upgrades to interconnect new generating facilities. ISO-NE states that it already
evaluates static synchronous compensators when evaluating interconnection requests.3028
Similarly, as Indicated PJM TOs attest, PJM already considers static synchronous
compensators in its interconnection and transmission planning processes.3029
Accordingly, we find that synchronous and static VAR compensators are appropriately
included in the list of alternative transmission technologies enumerated in this final rule
that transmission providers must evaluate in the interconnection process.
Regarding advanced power flow controls, we find that these devices allow power
to be pushed and pulled to alternate lines with spare capacity leading to maximum

utilization of transmission capacity and mitigation of overloads. Advanced power flow
control devices can be scaled back as needed, providing an advantage over new lines or
reconductors.3030 PacifiCorp attests that it often considers the use of advanced power
flow control devices as potential alternatives to standard system infrastructure, and
Indicated PJM TOs note that PJM and PJM transmission owners already consider the
appropriateness of power flow control devices when conducting interconnection
studies.3031 As discussed above, our decision to modify the NOPR proposal and require
transmission providers to evaluate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies
in all instances addresses Indicated PJM TOs’ statement that evaluation of advanced
power flow control devices in the interconnection process would significantly increase
the complexity of interconnection studies and thus could cause delays in their
completion.3032 We acknowledge the possibility that use of advanced power flow control
devices can have impacts on line impedance which may result in issues in other parts of
the system, as suggested by MISO. However, the requirement of this Final Rule is
merely that the transmission provider evaluate each alternative transmission technology,
not that they deploy them in all circumstances. We appreciate, and expect, that if a
transmission provider’s evaluation demonstrates that deployment of advanced power
flow control devices would create issues on the transmission provider’s system as

described by MISO, it will not select that advanced power flow control as the network
upgrade.3033
We also retain transmission switching on the enumerated list of alternative
technologies in this final rule. Transmission switching can be used to route energy
around areas with high congestion and improve the overall transfer capability of the
system, potentially resulting in lower network upgrade costs. In regard to PacifiCorp’s
argument that transmission switching is a complex process that can be implemented only
under very particular factual scenarios and system conditions, transmission providers are
already required to evaluate the impact of the proposed interconnection on the reliability
of the transmission system3034 and thus should understand whether the factual scenarios
and system conditions exist that would make a transmission switching solution
appropriate. In response to Tri-State’s question about whether transmission switching is
meant to be a remedial action scheme or to create permanent normally open points on the
system, this final rule does not prescribe how transmission providers deploy any of the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies on their systems if they determine to
use them. To Tri-State’s concern that transmission switching solutions may be
“problematic in highly interconnected systems not operating in an RTO/ISO,” we
reiterate that transmission providers retain the discretion to determine whether to deploy

any of the enumerated alternative transmission technologies, including transmission
switching solutions.
We find that the record supports including synchronous condensers and voltage
source converters to the list because these technologies similarly may reduce
interconnection costs in situations where voltage support is a constraint and where a new
or modified transmission line with these technologies may provide a lower cost network
upgrade option to interconnect new generating facilities. Specifically, ISO-NE states that
it already evaluates synchronous condensers when evaluating interconnection
requests,3035 and NARUC and Xcel urge the Commission to include evaluation of
synchronous condensers and voltage source converters in the interconnection process. 3036
We also add advanced conductors and tower lifting to the list of alternative
transmission technologies enumerated in this final rule. We note the comments arguing
that advanced conductors may be beneficial as network upgrades.3037 ACORE explains
that deploying advanced conductors can significantly increase transmission capacity and
allow for the interconnection of new generating facilities without the construction of new
network upgrades.3038 Similarly, we find that tower lifting has the potential to increase

increasing transmission line ratings, there will be more “headroom” on the system to

interconnection customers, we require transmission providers to evaluate advanced
conductors and tower lifting in the interconnection process.
We remove dynamic line ratings from the list of enumerated alternative
transmission technologies proposed in the NOPR. We agree with commenters that the
technology may be less beneficial in the interconnection context than in the transmission
operations and planning context because, for example, dynamic line ratings’ ability to
increase the available interconnection service depends on favorable weather and
congestion parameters.3041 That is, while dynamic line ratings may relieve congestion to

that tower lifting may require a modification to a certificate of public convenience and
necessity (CPCN) or similar permit issued by a state utility regulator, which may include
tower height limits or other physical restrictions. To the extent the transmission provider
considers potential delays or the possibility of not receiving such a state CPCN
modification when evaluating potential network upgrades, it should include a similar
consideration in its evaluation of alternative transmission technologies.

interconnect a generating facility to the transmission system during all hours.
We decline to add storage that performs a transmission function to the list of
alternative transmission technologies enumerated in this final rule. The Commission has
determined that the evaluation of whether a storage resource performs a transmission
function requires a case-by-case analysis of either how a particular storage resource
would be operated or the requirements set forth in a tariff governing selection of such
storage resources. For example, in approving SPP’s proposal to establish a framework
under which an electric storage resource may be considered a transmission asset (thereby
making the selected storage resources eligible for cost-based rate recovery through
transmission rates), the Commission identified five considerations that, together, ensure
that a selected storage resource will serve a transmission function.3042
We clarify that transmission providers are not precluded from studying a
technology that is not included in the enumerated list of alternative transmission
technologies. Under the modified requirement, transmission providers must evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies in all instances, but we are not
precluding a transmission provider from studying or evaluating any other technology,
including those such as dynamic line ratings that we have determined not to add to the list

transmission providers are not required to propose and justify on compliance any

rule.
In the NOPR, the Commission generally proposed a method to allocate the costs
of cluster studies and the costs of network upgrades within a cluster through the

comment on how costs incurred for evaluating alternative transmission technology study
requests would be allocated among interconnection customers in the cluster under a
NOPR proposal in which interconnection customers would identify and request particular
technologies to be studied.3045 Given our modification to the NOPR proposal to require
transmission providers to evaluate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies
in the pro forma LGIP cluster study on behalf of the whole cluster, rather than upon an

allocation of cluster study costs for, and substation and system network upgrades
associated with, the enumerated alternative transmission technologies must be consistent
with the allocation of costs for cluster studies and associated substation and system
network upgrades for any other network upgrades because the enumerated alternative
transmission technologies located on the high-side of the point of interconnection would
fall within the definition of substation and system network upgrades,3046 and they would
be adopted only if they resolve system reliability issues triggered by an interconnection
request. In other words, the enumerated alternative transmission technologies must be
included among the set of options transmission providers consider when studying a
cluster and any implemented enumerated alternative transmission technologies must
receive the same cost treatment as any other option.
Accordingly, the cost allocation concerns raised by several commenters in
response to the NOPR proposal are now unfounded.3047 Regarding MISO’s concern that
some alternative transmission technologies may shift the burden of system impacts to
other parties,3048 we find that the possibility of this burden shifting is minimal because the

revised pro forma LGIP, as adopted in this final rule, requires transmission providers to
evaluate the enumerated alternative transmission technologies on a cluster-wide basis for
feasibility, cost, and time savings. We recognize that, after the transmission provider
evaluates the enumerated alternative transmission technologies, the transmission
provider, in its sole discretion, may still decide to remedy an identified reliability
problem with a traditional network upgrade.
Regarding cost treatment for the enumerated alternative transmission technologies
in the pro forma SGIP, the Commission did not propose to require, and this final rule
does not adopt, cluster studies for small generator interconnection requests. Accordingly,
the study process for small generating facilities in the pro forma SGIP remains a serial
process and costs for evaluating the enumerated alternative transmission technologies
must be allocated to the small generator interconnection request being studied. Likewise,
the costs for any implemented enumerated alternative transmission technologies must be
allocated to a small generator interconnection customer consistent with the allocation of
any other network upgrade costs in the small generator interconnection process.
As explained in Section III.A.3 of this final rule, we are not requiring transmission
providers to allocate study costs on a pro rata basis, as Fervo Energy requests. Because
this final rule does not adopt the NOPR proposal for interconnection customers to request
the study of particular technologies, we need not address the arguments raised by
NARUC and Indicated PJM TOs related to the study costs associated with that unadopted
proposal.

The Commission sought comment on whether transmission providers should be
required to evaluate whether alternative transmission technologies can be deployed on a
temporary basis to provide provisional interconnection service. We are not persuaded by
arguments in favor of such a requirement. While we acknowledge commenters’
arguments that alternative transmission technologies could serve as a temporary solution
to reduce the overall costs and delays of generator interconnection, we agree with MISO
that mandatory evaluation of alternative transmission technologies for provisional
interconnection service could hinder ensuring that interconnection customers are able to
interconnect in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner by adding burden and
delay.3049
The Commission also sought comment on whether alternative transmission
technologies as supplements for, or in the place of, traditional network upgrades was
sufficient to guarantee a level of service to accommodate an interconnection customer
seeking NRIS, or whether such a network upgrade could only relate to ERIS.3050 We
agree with commenters that the enumerated alternative transmission technologies may
enable NRIS, but such a determination will be dependent on the analysis by the particular
transmission provider and the particular technology under evaluation. We decline to
adopt Clean Energy Association’s proposal that transmission providers be required to
post additional information beyond the explanation of the results of the evaluation of

must include, in the applicable study report, an explanation of the results of the
evaluation of the enumerated alternative transmission technologies for feasibility, cost,
and time savings.
We find that the following commenters’ proposals are outside the scope of this
proceeding and, therefore, we do not address the substance: (1) requiring transmission
providers to consider alternative transmission technologies in market operations at the
request of the interconnection customer;3051 (2) adding language to the pro forma LGIA
that would allow interconnection facilities to convert to distribution or regional
transmission facilities;3052 and (3) requiring transmission providers to study and
implement advanced transmission technologies when network upgrades are needed but
cannot be completed within three years of being identified.3053
Because we adopt a requirement for transmission providers to evaluate the
enumerated alternative transmission technologies, rather than at the request of the
interconnection customer, we do not address comments regarding the following issues,
which become moot by this modification to the NOPR proposal: the timing of submission
of the alternative transmission technology evaluation request;3054 the burden of proof for

customer can request evaluation of an alternative transmission technology not on the
required list;3058 and whether transmission providers need to perform a separate study for
each requested alternative transmission technology.3059
We do not find compelling commenters’ request that the Commission not require
the evaluation of alternative transmission technologies while other proceedings
concerning grid enhancing technologies are pending.3060 The Commission proposed and
received extensive comment on evaluation of alternative transmission technologies in the
interconnection process. Based on the record, we find that it is appropriate for the
Commission to adopt a modified NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
evaluate the required list of enumerated alternative transmission technologies.

- 1037 Annual Informational Report
i.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, in order to add transparency to the evaluation process and
deployment of alternative transmission technologies in generator interconnection
processes, the Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP
to require transmission providers to submit an annual informational report to the
Commission that details whether, and if so how, advanced power flow control,
transmission switching, dynamic line ratings, static synchronous compensators, and static
VAR compensators were considered in interconnection requests over the last year.3061
The Commission proposed to create a new docket to collect all annual informational
report filings, and proposed that any informational reports that transmission providers file
at the Commission would be for informational purposes and would neither be formally
noticed nor require additional action by the Commission. The Commission sought
comment on: (1) whether to require transmission providers to explain why an alternative
transmission technology that was considered was not deployed; and (2) the scope of the
annual informational report, and whether additional information should be included.

Comments in Support

A broad group of commenters support the NOPR proposal.3062 Many commenters
agree that the reports would be beneficial to interconnection customers because they
would provide insight as to why alternative transmission technologies were or were not
deployed.3063 Some commenters contend that the annual informational report will allow
interconnection customers to better tailor their requests to consider alternative
transmission technologies, such that those requests are most likely to be successful.3064
Similarly, commenters argue that the annual informational reports would allow sharing of
best practices in the industry on the use of these technologies and their evaluation, and
would lessen concerns over the potential risks of new technologies by socializing
examples of their consideration and implementation.3065 ELCON and Fervo Energy
assert that the annual informational reports will provide interconnection customers with

additional information to ascertain the feasibility of certain configurations and
interconnection points.3066
Additionally, Enel states that transmission providers can be resistant to using
advanced transmission technologies, and the annual informational report will allow the
Commission to evaluate whether a transmission provider is artificially restricting the use
of advanced transmission technologies, similar to the study completion metrics required
by the Commission in Order No. 845.3067 Some commenters argue that if the
Commission observes that transmission providers are routinely citing certain technical or
other reasons for not deploying certain technologies, the annual informational report will
provide a record from which it can initiate action in a separate proceeding to remedy the
issue.3068
Several commenters argue in support of the annual informational report to
promote transparency between market participants, interconnection customers, and
regulators.3069 Lastly, commenters argue that the additional work and obligation for the
annual informational report would be an effective use of limited resources to benefit the
efficiency, transparency, and modernization of the interconnection process.3070

Comments in Opposition

Some commenters oppose the proposal on the basis that it would be too
burdensome.3071 Xcel Energy does not believe annual informational reports are necessary
and requests that any informational reporting requirements be limited to decrease the
burden on the engineers that need to focus on performing the interconnection studies.3072
PacifiCorp states that imposing an additional reporting obligation on transmission
providers would not only be duplicative, but it would add to an already significant list of
administrative tasks that transmission providers must undertake to comply with existing,
and proposed, interconnection obligations, without clear benefit.3073 NYTOs believe that
preparing and submitting an annual informational report with detailed analysis of the
consideration of alternative transmission technologies would require dedicated resources
on the part of the transmission provider.3074 MISO asserts that the annual informational
report at this time may not be useful, especially in the already transparent RTO/ISO
context, and could divert scarce staff resources from the work of moving forward in the
study and agreements process for implementing much-needed new generation.3075

Similarly, Indicated PJM TOs state that PJM currently maintains a publicly available
website that details all the types of network upgrades necessary to support
interconnections, including the types of devices identified here by the Commission.3076
CAISO also opposes the proposal because CAISO believes that it is contrary to the goal
of reducing interconnection queue backlogs by adding more studies and reporting
requirements onto transmission provider staff.3077
Idaho Power believes that the report may simply result in more disputes over why
one entity allows a particular technology, while another one does not.3078
CAISO and MISO also argue that there is limited value to interconnection
reports.3079 CAISO argues that in this NOPR, the Commission recognizes that imposing
reporting requirements in Order No. 845 failed to incentivize transmission providers to
meet their study obligations, and thus the Commission should not repeat that mistake here
by burdening transmission provider staff with yet another reporting requirement.3080

Comments on Specific Proposal

Several commenters emphasize the importance of transparency when an
alternative transmission technology is not selected.3082 ENGIE asks the Commission to
require transmission providers to provide publicly available information addressing why
or why not an alternative transmission technology was adopted or rejected in a specific
case.3083 CTC Global believes that transmission providers should be required to include
explanations regarding the alternative transmission technologies considered, deployed, or
rejected in the annual reports.3084 CTC Global requests that the Commission also
mandate reporting on the energy efficiency of the components used in various network
upgrades and through the interconnection process.3085 Eversource suggests that, in
addition to the five technologies listed in the NOPR, transmission providers be allowed to
provide reporting on any other grid enhancing technology or alternative transmission
technology that was considered during the prior year.3086

In contrast, Ameren argues that, if the Commission imposes this reporting burden
on transmission providers, it should not further exacerbate the burden by requiring the
transmission provider to also report explanations of common obstacles to the use of these
alternative transmission technologies.3087 Instead, Ameren states that the Commission
should encourage interconnection customers and transmission providers to share with
Commission staff through a technical conference or other forum the types of technologies
being considered and whether adopted. Ameren suggests that this type of information
gathering should be undertaken before the Commission imposes specific reforms or
reporting requirements.

Commission Determination

We decline to adopt the NOPR proposal to require transmission providers to
submit an annual informational report to the Commission that details whether, and if so
how, the list of alternative transmission technologies were considered in interconnection
studies over the last year. We are persuaded by commenters’ arguments that the time and
resources required to produce the annual informational report may hinder the ability to
increase the speed of interconnection queue processing.3088 We find that these challenges
outweigh the incremental increased transparency to the evaluation process and
deployment of alternative transmission technologies in generator interconnection

processes, particularly in light of additional reporting requirements in other parts of this
final rule.
Specifically, the annual informational report would be duplicative of the
requirement in section 7.3 of the pro forma LGIP and sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.10 of the pro
forma SGIP that we adopt in this final rule. Under these provisions, transmission
providers must explain how the required alternative transmission technologies were
evaluated for feasibility, cost, and time savings in each pro forma LGIP cluster study
report or pro forma SGIP feasibility study and system impact study reports. The
description of the results of the evaluation required in these reports should provide
transparency into the evaluation process and deployment of alternative transmission
technologies in generator interconnection processes. In response to Enel’s argument that
an annual informational report will allow the Commission to evaluate if a transmission
provider is artificially restricting the use of alternative transmission technologies, we find
that this concern is adequately addressed through the modified requirement that
transmission providers evaluate all required alternative transmission technologies by
default in all studies and restudies.

Modeling Requirements
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that the pro forma LGIP and
pro forma SGIP may be unduly discriminatory or preferential to the extent that they do

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 1045 -

not require non-synchronous generating facilities to provide accurate and validated
models to transmission providers during the generator interconnection process.3089
Specifically, the Commission noted that, while Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro
forma LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP require all generating facilities to
submit certain types of information, the information required is only sufficient to
accurately model the behavior of synchronous generating facilities. The Commission
stated its concern that, without a reform to require interconnection customers developing
non-synchronous generating facilities3090 to provide sufficiently accurate and validated
models, interconnection studies may not identify the appropriate interconnection facilities
and network upgrades, which could lead to unjust and unreasonable rates for
interconnection service.3091
The Commission proposed to revise Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro forma
LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP to ensure that all interconnection
customers requesting to interconnect a non-synchronous generating facility must provide

Non-synchronous generating facilities are “connected to the bulk power

the transmission provider with the models needed for accurate interconnection studies.3092
Pursuant to this proposal, interconnection customers requesting to interconnect a nonsynchronous generating facility would be required to provide models that contain the
details necessary to accurately model the performance of the generating facility in
response to system disturbances in accordance with the control system settings that would
be used by the interconnection customer during the commissioning and operation of the
generating facility.
Specifically, the Commission proposed to require each interconnection customer
requesting to interconnect a non-synchronous generating facility to submit to the
transmission provider: (1) a validated, user-defined root mean square (RMS) positive
sequence dynamic model; (2) an appropriately parameterized, generic library RMS
positive sequence dynamic model, including a model block diagram of the inverter
control system and plant control system, that corresponds to a model listed in a new table
of acceptable models or a model otherwise approved by WECC; and (3) a validated EMT
model, if the transmission provider performs an EMT study as part of the interconnection
study process.3093
With regard to the validated, user-defined RMS positive sequence dynamic model,
the Commission proposed to define a user-defined model as any set of programming code
created by equipment manufacturers or developers that captures the latest features of

controllers that are mainly software-based and represents the entities’ control strategies
but does not necessarily correspond to any particular generic library model.3094 The
Commission explained that in order for this model to be “validated,” it must be
confirmed that the equipment behavior is consistent with the model behavior, and
described how the interconnection customer may make such confirmation.
With regard to the appropriately parameterized, generic library RMS positive
sequence dynamic model, the Commission proposed a table of acceptable generic library
models based on the current WECC list of approved dynamic models for renewable
energy generating facilities.3095 The Commission noted that WECC’s list of approved
dynamic models has also been integrated into NERC reliability guidelines and that these
models represent the current state of the art with regard to dynamic modeling
requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities.
The Commission stated that it believed that these models represent the full
spectrum of modeling data that transmission providers need to perform accurate
interconnection studies for non-synchronous generating facilities.3096 The Commission
also recognized that the modeling data proposed to be required from non-synchronous
generating facilities may be more voluminous than that required of synchronous
generating facilities; however, the Commission noted that this data submission

requirement is intended to result in a comparable level of modeling accuracy among all
generating facilities.
The Commission stated that an interconnection customer’s failure to provide the
above information within the deadlines established in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma
SGIP would make the interconnection request incomplete and would be considered
invalid in accordance with section 3.4.3 of the pro forma LGIP and section 1.3 of the pro
forma SGIP. 3097 Pursuant to those provisions, if the interconnection customer does not
cure the deficiency within the 10-business day cure period, the interconnection request
will be considered withdrawn pursuant to section 3.7 of the pro forma LGIP and section
1.3 of the pro forma SGIP. The Commission also proposed to require that any proposed
modification of the interconnection request be accompanied by updated models of the
proposed generating facility.3098
The Commission sought comment on: (1) whether the proposed reforms are
necessary and/or sufficient to ensure that interconnection customers proposing nonsynchronous generating facilities would submit models during the generator
interconnection process that accurately reflect the behavior of their proposed generating
facility; (2) whether the inclusion of the table based on NERC guidelines that cite
WECC-approved models is appropriate; and (3) if not, how the Commission could

Comments in Opposition

Several commenters oppose the NOPR proposal in its entirety,3105 while additional
commenters express concerns about specific aspects. Pine Gate asserts that the
Commission should not incorporate requirements into the pro forma LGIP and pro forma

process.3106 Pine Gate states that the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA require
interconnection customers to remain compliant with the applicable reliability standards,
and recommends that the Commission address these modeling and performance reforms
under the generic statement regarding compliance with applicable NERC Reliability
Standards or by adding a similar statement in each applicable section of article 9 in the
pro forma LGIA.3107
NYISO argues that the final rule should not include a modeling requirement
because it would be inefficient and necessitate a rebuild of NYISO’s study base case.3108

NYISO explains that, if the NOPR proposal is adopted, its interconnection study analysis
would take much longer to ensure accurate results, significantly slowing the
interconnection process.
ENGIE argues that the required models in the NOPR proposal are very detailed,
there are few consultants that perform this modeling, and the value obtained is low
because the study likely will become outdated as project components are substituted for
more advanced technologies. ENGIE recommends requiring a power flow and dynamic
model, which it contends provides sufficient information on reliability impacts.3109

Models Not Available Early in
Interconnection Study Process

Multiple commenters argue that accurate models for non-synchronous generating
facilities may not be available early in the interconnection study process and may need to
be updated during the process.3112 Pine Gate and Public Interest Organizations assert that
the Commission should revise the NOPR proposal to allow for later submission of such
models to reduce the administrative burden on transmission providers and
interconnection customers.3113

requested very early in the interconnection study process, before product feature details
have been finalized, may need to be updated prior to commercial operation, and argue
that minor model changes should not result in excessive triggering of material
modification rules.3115
Alliant Energy and PPL state that technical information provided at the time an
interconnection request is submitted can become outdated during the interconnection
study process,3116 and Alliant Energy asserts that the Commission should therefore
provide for flexibility as to when and how required information for modeling
requirements is provided.3117 Ørsted argues that offshore wind interconnection customers
may not be able to provide a validated model at the time of the interconnection request
due to long lead times in generating facility development and equipment that is still being
developed.3118

RMS Models

Several commenters request modifications to the proposed requirements for RMS
models.3120 Tesla and SEIA argue that the Commission should require transmission
providers to accept user-defined library RMS positive sequence dynamics models, as
these models better reflect the actual technology intended to be used by the resource,
results in a much greater degree of modeling accuracy, and can help support greater
penetration of renewable resources.3121 In addition, Tesla suggests that the Commission
seek informational submissions from transmission providers regarding software tools and
resources needed to integrate more accurate user-defined RMS modeling. Clean Energy
Associations argue that the transmission provider should have discretion to require a
user-defined RMS model, a generic library RMS model (with site-specific
parameterization), or both, instead of always being required to collect both.3122 MISO

IBR technology before the Commission establishes modeling standards that might stifle
technological improvements.3124
Other commenters express concern with the difficulties of user-defined models.3125
Eversource requests that the Commission specify that all positive sequence models
provided must be non-proprietary and accessible to neighboring utilities, system
operators, and other entities that need to access them.3126 ISO-NE asserts that it does not
accept user-defined models under its interconnection study procedures and requests that

Model Validation

Some commenters argue that the Commission should provide further direction
regarding model validation requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities.3128
NERC and SDG&E argue that reliability assessments indicate that model validation with
actual installed equipment and a “true-up” of generator interconnection modeling would
help ensure proper analysis and studies prior to commissioning.3129 NERC recommends
that the Commission enhance the interconnection process by ensuring more rigorous
plant commissioning, with both the interconnection customer and the transmission
provider signing off on models used in studies as compared with actual installed
equipment.3130 In addition, NERC asks the Commission to require transmission providers
to conduct quality review of models before study and require interconnection customers
to satisfy quality review milestones.3131
Tesla argues that, in lieu of multiple attestations or test data, the Commission
should develop an approach to validation that requires interconnection customers to

submit “model-to-model” and “product-to-model” benchmarking data for nonsynchronous generating facilities.3132
Clean Energy Associations assert that the Commission should add language that
provides that the attestation required for model validation be the best available by the
original equipment manufacturer at the time of model delivery.3133 In addition, Clean
Energy Associations and Ørsted argue that the Commission should define the phrase
“accurate and validated models.”3134 Clean Energy Associations explain that it is
common practice to submit an interconnection request with advanced, next-generation
equipment that the manufacturer may still be developing, in which case the product and
validated models may not be available at the time of the interconnection request, and
request that the Commission allow transmission providers flexibility to accommodate
such new equipment in their interconnection studies.3135
Clean Energy Associations and Ørsted assert that, if accurate and validated models
require a comparison with unit level factory tests, then this may not be feasible for
offshore wind farms, especially if they are connecting with HVDC transmission
technology.3136 They explain that these types of configurations are often project-specific

and do not have a definition of a “validated model.” Ørsted also requests that the
Commission explain why a “model block diagram of the inverter control system and
plant control system” is necessary given the availability of WECC model block diagrams
in simulation tools.3137
EPRI argues that the Commission should modify the language in the pro forma
LGIA and pro forma SGIA to ensure that all models are validated and appropriately
parameterized.3138 EPRI contends that the NOPR proposal fails to provide adequate
directions and requirements with respect to model validation, testing, verification, and
conformity assessment, as required during various stages of the interconnection process.
EPRI asserts that a “validated” plant model would not be available during the
interconnection study stage because validation of the plant model is not possible—within
reasonable efforts—until after the commissioning and commercial operation of the
generating facility. EPRI states that alternatives to this would be requiring generic
models that are appropriately parametrized and conform to IEEE Standard 2800-2022
requirements.

Commission should provide a table based on NERC guidelines that cite WECC-approved
models as one but not the only example.3140 Shell agrees that a table based on NERC
guidelines is appropriate as long as the functionality and proprietary controls are
adequately reflected (e.g., mimic the actual inverter performance of manufacturers’
models).3141 Shell explains that a generic model may not be able to support the
operational characteristics of inverters. SPP states that, in its experience, some
manufacturers do not support WECC-approved generic dynamics models and that having
Commission support for more specific, detailed, and vetted modeling information
requirements will be helpful to improve data quality and access.3142
R Street and EPRI offer alternatives to a table based on NERC guidelines that cite
WECC-approved models.3143 R Street argues that providing a list of models in the final
rule is not prudent given the dynamic nature of the table, and that the list should instead
be posted on relevant public industry websites, including those of NERC.3144 EPRI states
that one alternative could be to include a reference and hyperlink to the NERC and

EMT Modeling

NERC and EPRI support the EMT modeling proposal in the NOPR.3146 NERC
recommends that all non-synchronous generating facilities perform EMT models prior to
interconnection for consideration by transmission operators and planners.3147 NERC
contends that event analysis underscores the value of EMT studies in helping manage
reliability risks of the modern transmission system.
EPRI agrees that performing EMT studies should be at the discretion of the
transmission provider.3148 However, EPRI recommends collecting validated and
appropriately parametrized EMT models during the interconnection process regardless of
whether the transmission provider performs an EMT study because an EMT study may
become necessary in the future, and the interconnection stage is the best time to obtain
models due to the close coordination between interconnection customers, consultants,
equipment manufacturers, and generating facility designers. EPRI also suggests that an

industry-accepted generic EMT model could be required in lieu of a validated EMT
model.3149
Clean Energy Associations argue that the Commission should require submission
of an EMT model one year before the scheduled commercial operation date of the nonsynchronous generating facility if the transmission provider performs an EMT study as
part of the interconnection study process.3150 Clean Energy Associations assert that, if the
Commission moves forward with a requirement for interconnection customers to provide
EMT models, it should require the transmission provider and its consultants to protect
these models with the highest degree of confidentiality because these models contain
proprietary and highly commercially sensitive material that could pose a reliability risk if
obtained by malicious actors.
Several commenters oppose the EMT modeling proposal.3151 AES contends that
EMT modeling is not yet used widely in the industry and thus should not be adopted as a
minimum standard.3152

stability studies, require highly specialized engineering experience to perform, and are

limited to modeling a fraction of a transmission provider’s transmission system.3153
Longroad Energy asserts that the Commission should continue to allow transmission
providers the discretion to determine where such studies will meaningfully impact the
interconnection requirements for an interconnection request. Further, Longroad Energy
asserts that the Commission should require transmission providers to publish studies
demonstrating the need for EMT studies to prevent unnecessarily imposing a costly,
time-consuming step in the interconnection study process.
SEIA asserts that EMT models are not yet industry standard models, require
significant processing power compared to RMS models, and are not necessarily more
accurate than RMS models.3154 Bonneville asserts that it has found that EMT modeling
studies are rarely necessary, and therefore any requirement to provide EMT models or
studies should be left to the transmission provider’s discretion.3155

opportunities for interconnection customers to adopt newer, more advanced equipment
after they enter the interconnection queue. ClearPath further explains that supply chain
challenges may force an interconnection customer to change equipment procurement
unexpectedly while in the interconnection queue, and requests that the Commission
explain whether a change in equipment that necessitates submitting new models and data
is considered a material modification.

interconnection improvement efforts.3159
EPRI states that the NOPR proposal does not specify information and data that the
transmission providers may need to provide to the interconnection customer during the

etc.).3160 EPRI asserts that the final rule could consider the list of data from Annex H of
IEEE 2800-2022, which includes definitions that could help define the combined
generating and storage service level MW of a generating facility referred to in the NOPR
proposal, including the continuous rating, continuous absorption rating, and short-term
rating for IBRs.

Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro
forma LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP to require each interconnection
customer requesting to interconnect a non-synchronous generating facility to submit to
the transmission provider: (1) a validated user-defined RMS positive sequence dynamic
model; (2) an appropriately parameterized generic library RMS positive sequence
dynamic model, including a model block diagram of the inverter control system and plant

control system, that corresponds to a model listed in a new table of acceptable models or
a model otherwise approved by WECC; and (3) a validated EMT model, if the
transmission provider performs an EMT study as part of the interconnection study
process.
We also adopt the NOPR proposals to: (1) define a user-defined model as any set
of programming code created by equipment manufacturers or developers that captures the
latest features of controllers that are mainly software-based and represent the entities’
control strategies but does not necessarily correspond to any particular generic library
model, as contained in Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP and
Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP; (2) revise Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the
pro forma LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP to add a table of acceptable
generic library models, based on the current WECC list of approved dynamic models for
renewable energy generating facilities; and (3) revise section 4.4.4 of the pro forma LGIP
and section 1.4 of the pro forma SGIP to require that any proposed modification of the
interconnection request be accompanied by updated models of the proposed generating
facility.
Based on the record before us, we affirm the Commission’s preliminary finding in
the NOPR that the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP are unduly discriminatory or
preferential because they do not require non-synchronous generating facilities to provide
accurate and validated models to transmission providers during the generator
interconnection process that provide a comparable degree of accuracy as the models
required of a synchronous generator. The current pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

provisions ensure that synchronous generating facilities are required to provide accurate,
validated models to transmission providers during the generator interconnection process.
However, the current pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP provisions are insufficient to
ensure that non-synchronous generating facilities submit models with a comparable level
of accuracy.
Additionally, we find that the lack of a requirement for non-synchronous
generating facilities to provide accurate and validated models to transmission providers in
the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP results in unjust and unreasonable rates.
Accurate and validated models are necessary to minimize study delays and to ensure that
transmission providers conduct accurate interconnection studies that identify the
necessary interconnection facilities and network upgrades to accommodate the
interconnection request. Data issues are commonly cited as a major source of study
delays, which contributes to interconnection queue backlogs.3161 As described above,
interconnection queue backlogs create uncertainty in the timing and cost of
interconnecting to the transmission system and hinders the timely development of new
generation. Moreover, without accurate models, transmission providers cannot conduct
accurate interconnection studies that identify the appropriate interconnection facilities
and network upgrades, leading to the inaccurate assignment of interconnection costs and
resulting in Commission-jurisdictional rates that are unjust and unreasonable.3162

Furthermore, many commenters agree that this reform will help prevent potential
reliability concerns if non-synchronous generating facilities do not perform when in
service as modeled during the interconnection process.3163 For example, additional
modeling requirements will significantly improve the accuracy of both interconnection
and reliability studies as well as address concerns regarding non-synchronous generation
disturbance events.3164
NYISO argues that the final rule would be inefficient and necessitate a rebuild of
NYISO’s study base case, take longer to ensure accurate results, and significantly slow
the interconnection process.3165 While we will not opine here on the NYISO-specific
compliance with the final rule, we disagree that requiring accurate dynamic models of
generating facilities will make the interconnection process take longer to ensure accurate
results. To the contrary, we find here that a lack of accurate models is a major cause of
study delays and contributes to interconnection study backlogs.

The majority of commenters support the NOPR proposal.3166 We affirm that,
consistent with this final rule, all interconnection customers requesting to interconnect a
non-synchronous generating facility must provide the transmission provider with the
required models needed for accurate interconnection studies. We find that the models
required herein contain the details necessary to accurately model the performance of the
non-synchronous generating facility in response to system disturbances, and we decline
to adopt alternative model proposals put forth by commenters. This reform promotes a
consistent approach among all generating facilities with respect to modeling, such that all
interconnection customers are required to submit information sufficient to accurately
model the behavior of their proposed generating facilities.
We decline to adopt AES’s request for a 20-day cure period for model
deficiencies.3167 Under the proposed provisions, if an interconnection customer fails to
provide the required models above within the deadlines established in the pro forma

pro forma SGIP. Pursuant to those provisions, if the interconnection customer does not
cure such a deficiency within the 10-business day cure period, the interconnection request
will be considered withdrawn pursuant to section 3.7 of the pro forma LGIP and section
1.3 of the pro forma SGIP. In it its request, AES provides no explanation for why the
10-business day cure period is insufficient. Moreover, we believe that the existing
10-business day cure period should be consistently applied to all interconnection request
deficiencies and that having an extended cure period for model deficiencies would
potentially introduce delays in the interconnection process. We note that interconnection
customers may submit their interconnection requests early in the customer request
window, which will allow for more time to ensure their models are valid.
We disagree with Pine Gate that the revisions to the pro forma LGIP and pro
forma SGIP, as adopted, incorporate requirements into the pro forma LGIP and pro
forma SGIP that are already being addressed by NERC through the standards
development process.3168 We note that NERC supports the NOPR proposal and argues
that the existing interconnection process does not provide sufficiently accurate and
validated models for non-synchronous generating facilities to transmission providers. 3169

the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP. In addition, the pro forma LGIA and pro
forma SGIA revisions apply to a wide spectrum of generating facilities, including newly
interconnecting generating facilities that are currently outside the bounds of NERC’s
jurisdiction.3170 As such, we find that this reform can holistically address the identified
issues alongside the NERC standards; even if NERC is taking action, that need not
prevent us from taking action here.
We disagree with ENGIE that the value obtained from the models in the NOPR
proposal is low because of the likelihood that the study will be outdated as project
components are substituted with more advanced technology.3171 We recognize that the
project components for non-synchronous generating facilities may change during the
interconnection process. We find, however, that this does not diminish the value of a
transmission provider receiving the identified information from interconnection
customers requesting to interconnect a non-synchronous generating facility and receiving
models that represent the best information interconnection customers have available
about their proposed generating facilities because these models will ensure that the
transmission provider can accurately model the impact of the proposed generating facility

throughout the interconnection process. In addition, proposed section 4.4.4 of the
pro forma LGIP and section 1.4 of the pro forma SGIP require that any modification of
the interconnection request be accompanied by updates to the models. Pursuant to these
provisions, the models are required to be updated as project components are changed.
Ensuring that the model of the proposed generating facility is accurate throughout the
interconnection study process will allow the interconnection customer to understand the
actual, potential impact on their interconnection request of changing these project
components as they are considering such technological advancements.
Similarly, we disagree with commenters that argue that accurate models for nonsynchronous generating facilities may not be available early in the interconnection study
process and may need to be updated during that process.3172 We find that the reforms we
adopt herein are consistent with the principles behind other requirements in the pro forma
LGIP and pro forma SGIP, namely those that set forth requirements for an
interconnection request, including requirements that requests be viable and welldefined.3173 The requirement to submit accurate models also reduces the chance that a
transmission provider would need to perform additional studies, in this case if an
interconnection customer submits models that are inaccurate and those inaccuracies are

not discovered until late in the interconnection process. In that instance, i.e., if model
validation occurs at a point further into the interconnection process, inaccurate models
that are used in interconnection studies could create errors in the studies, potentially
leading to restudies and subsequent delays which would frustrate the efficiency gained by
moving to a first-ready, first-served cluster study process. Further, we find that the
definition of a validated model (i.e., confirmation that the equipment behavior is
consistent with the modeled behavior) is sufficiently flexible to enable interconnection
customers to provide such a model with their interconnection requests.3174 Moreover, the
option for the interconnection customer to submit an attestation that the models
accurately reflect the expected behavior of a proposed generating facility would be based
in the interconnection customer’s best understanding at the time of the interconnection
request, providing further flexibility if the interconnection customer chooses to change
the equipment or control systems of the proposed generating facility, which is permitted
as part of the interconnection process.
In addition, we do not believe, as suggested by commenters,3175 that there is a need
to require transmission providers to make available additional information and system
data in order for an interconnection customer to develop an RMS model. Although
measured transmission system information is an input into the RMS model, the purpose
of the model is to represent the behavior of the facility itself, and the interconnection

customer should be able to use likely transmission system configurations to parameterize
and validate the RMS model. To the extent that the interconnection customer believes
that actual transmission data is required to tune the model block diagram, the scoping
meeting provides a venue for such discussions. The provisions set forth in new pro
forma LGIP section 3.4.6 further detail scoping meetings, which occur during the
customer engagement window.
We decline to adopt requirements that constrain the discretion of transmission
providers to use either user-defined RMS models or generic library RMS models, as
suggested by commenters.3176 We find that the transmission provider is in the best
position to determine the power flow modeling method that is best suited to ensuring the
reliability of its system.
We decline to modify the NOPR proposal to allow the transmission provider to
require either a user-defined RMS model or a generic library RMS model, as suggested
by Clean Energy Associations, rather than requiring the interconnection customer to
submit both, as adopted in this final rule.3177 We believe that requiring the
interconnection customer to submit both models is of value in providing the transmission
provider discretion to choose which model most accurately represents a given generating
facility’s behavior. Providing these models does not represent an unreasonable burden on

the interconnection customer, as the process of developing and parameterizing an RMS
model is significantly simpler than doing so for an EMT model.
We decline to require the user-defined RMS model to be compatible with the
transmission provider’s software and meet the transmission provider’s MOD-032-1
requirements at the time the interconnection request is submitted, as requested by
MISO.3178 While the user-defined RMS model will have to meet these requirements prior
to the cluster study for generating facilities seeking to interconnect pursuant to the pro
forma LGIP and optional feasibility study or system impact study for generating facilities
seeking to interconnect pursuant to the pro forma SGIP, the scoping meeting is the
appropriate time to provide and discuss this information in order to correct the model if it
is incompatible with the transmission provider’s software or otherwise causes the
transmission system model to be unable to solve.3179
We decline to require NERC to improve the degree to which power flow software
vendors allow accurate modeling of IBR technology, as requested by Longroad

and SGIAs, and placing obligations on NERC or vendors is outside the scope of this
proceeding. Equipment providers can develop and submit validated generic models to
the software vendors’ model libraries or the WECC model validation process to be
included in the WECC table of approved models, if they desire to do so.
In response to commenters that argue that the Commission should provide further
direction regarding model validation requirements for non-synchronous generating
facilities,3181 we note that Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP and
Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP, as adopted in this final rule, provide that, for a
model to be “validated,” the interconnection customer must provide evidence that the
equipment behavior is consistent with the model behavior. In addition, Attachment A to
Appendix 1 of the pro forma LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP provide that
this can involve, for example, an attestation from the interconnection customer that the
model accurately represents the entire generating facility, attestations from each
equipment manufacturer that the user-defined model accurately represents the relevant
component of the generating facility, or test data. We find that this definition of a
“validated” model and examples of an attestation in the proposal are sufficient and
provide flexibility to allow interconnection customers to provide such a model with their
interconnection requests. Therefore, we decline to adopt alternative proposals for model
validation put forth by commenters.

We decline to adopt alternatives and revisions to the table of acceptable generic
library models based on the current WECC list of approved dynamic models for
renewable energy generating facilities, as suggested by R Street and EPRI.3182 We find
that the table, as adopted, is appropriate because it represents the full spectrum of
modeling data that transmission providers need to perform accurate interconnection
studies for non-synchronous generating facilities. Nevertheless, we recognize that the list
of models approved by WECC is subject to change and note that the table provides that
“a model otherwise approved by [WECC],”3183 and not reflected in the table, would also
meet the model requirements.
In response to commenters that oppose a requirement for a validated EMT
model,3184 we note that these concerns mischaracterize the NOPR proposal as mandating
EMT models on a national basis. Rather, Attachment A to Appendix 1 of the pro forma
LGIP and Attachment 2 of the pro forma SGIP, as adopted, requires that, in
circumstances where the transmission provider performs an EMT study as part of its
interconnection study process, the interconnection customer must provide an EMT
model. We find that the transmission provider is in the best position to determine
whether an EMT study is necessary to ensure system reliability because the transmission

where and when regular dynamic modeling is inadequate to capture the true behavior of
generating facilities.
Similarly, we decline to adopt EPRI’s request to require EMT models regardless
of whether the transmission provider performs an EMT study.3185 Developing an EMT
model may place an unreasonable administrative burden on an interconnection customer
in situations where such a model is not used by the transmission provider. We also
decline to adopt EPRI’s request to allow use of an industry-accepted, generic EMT model
instead of a validated EMT model, as the record does not indicate that any such industryaccepted, generic models currently exist.3186
We decline Clean Energy Associations’ request that the Commission require
submission of an EMT model one year before the scheduled commercial operation date
of the non-synchronous generating facility if the transmission provider performs an EMT
study as part of the interconnection study process.3187 As noted above, we find that the
proposal for models to be submitted with the interconnection request is consistent with
the principles behind other requirements in the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP and
that transmission providers need these models to perform interconnection studies and
ensure that prospective generating facilities do not create reliability risks to the

Commission require the transmission provider and its consultants to protect the EMT
models and other information with the highest degree of confidentiality,3188 we note that
the pro forma generator interconnection procedures and agreements include provisions
for the treatment of confidential information.3189
In response to Invenergy’s request for clarification regarding whether a generic
EMT model may be provided if a validated EMT model is unavailable at the time of
submission of an interconnection request,3190 we note that there is currently no industryaccepted generic EMT model; therefore, a validated EMT model is required. In response
to Invenergy’s request for clarification regarding whether the interconnection customer
may submit this information by the time of a cluster restudy if a validated EMT model is
determined to be necessary, we clarify that a validated EMT model, if required by the
transmission provider, must be submitted with the interconnection request to proceed in
the interconnection study process. As validation can consist of, for example an
attestation from the interconnection customer that the model accurately represents the
entire generating facility, based on the interconnection customer’s understanding at the

validated EMT model at the time of the interconnection request.
In response to APS’ request for clarification on the number of times an
interconnection customer is allowed to provide inaccurate data and cure deficiencies
before an interconnection request is deemed withdrawn,3191 we note that section 3.4.4 of
the pro forma LGIP and section 1.3 of the pro forma SGIP provide the timeline for when
a transmission provider must notify an interconnection customer that its interconnection
request is deficient, and at that point, the interconnection customer has 10 business days
to provide the additional requested information. We clarify that an interconnection
customer has until the end of the 10 business-day period to cure deficiencies in its
interconnection request. In the case of the pro forma LGIP, the interconnection customer
may submit this information early in the cluster request window to ensure that there is
sufficient time to address any issues with the interconnection request and the required
models.
In response to ClearPath’s question regarding whether a change in equipment that
necessitates submitting updated models is considered a material modification,3192 we
highlight that section 4.4 of the pro forma LGIP and section 1.4 of the pro forma SGIP
set forth procedures for modifications to an interconnection request, including the
evaluation of technical changes to a request. Further, we note that section 4.6 of the pro

forma LGIP contains the transmission provider’s technological change procedure, which
was designed to allow transmission providers to evaluate whether equipment changes to
an interconnection request should trigger the material modification provisions. A change
in equipment may also qualify under the transmission provider’s definition of permissible
technological advancements in section 1 of the pro forma LGIP. This definition includes
advancements that the interconnection process can accommodate without triggering the
material modification provision of the pro forma LGIP.
In response to Consumers Energy’s recommendation that there should be
consistency between NERC Reliability Standards and data collection efforts and the
Commission’s rulemaking,3193 we are not persuaded that there is a conflict or duplication
between this final rule and NERC’s Reliability Standards and interconnection data
collection efforts. NERC Reliability Standards apply only to entities that are registered
with NERC. Many smaller non-synchronous generating facilities are currently excluded
from NERC registration but interconnect under the pro forma SGIP and pro forma LGIP
and execute, or request the unexecuted filing of, the pro forma SGIA or pro forma
LGIA.3194 The revisions to the pro forma interconnection procedures and pro forma
interconnection agreements require all new interconnection customers that interconnect

Ride Through Requirements
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission preliminarily found that the pro forma LGIA and
pro forma SGIA ride through provisions could result in undue discrimination and
preferential treatment.3196 The Commission stated that, although synchronous and nonsynchronous generating facilities are able to “ride through” system events and remain
online and continue to provide real and reactive power following a disturbance, the
existing pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA impose differing ride through
requirements because they fail to account for a non-synchronous generating facility’s
ability to engage in momentary cessation.3197 The Commission expressed concern that,
given advances in inverter technology, the lack of performance requirements regarding
the use of momentary cessation by non-synchronous generating facilities may not be
supportable on either a technical or cost basis.3198
The Commission proposed to require newly interconnecting non-synchronous
generating facilities to continue current injection inside the “no trip zone” of the

frequency and voltage ride through curves of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-024-3 or
its successor standards.3199 The Commission explained that the pro forma LGIA defined
the term “ride through” as the ability of the large generating facility to stay connected to
and synchronized with the transmission system during system disturbances within a range
of under-frequency and over-frequency conditions. The Commission proposed to expand
this definition to include the ability of the large generating facility to stay connected to
and synchronized with the transmission system during system disturbances within undervoltage and over-voltage conditions.
In addition, the Commission proposed to require any newly interconnecting nonsynchronous generating facility to have the ability, during abnormal frequency conditions
and voltage conditions within the “no trip zone” defined by NERC Reliability Standard
PRC-024-3 or its successor standards, to maintain power production at pre-disturbance
levels unless providing primary frequency response or fast frequency response, and to
have the ability to provide dynamic reactive power to maintain system voltage in
accordance with the generating facility’s voltage schedule.3200 The Commission sought
comment on whether adherence to these proposed requirements would be readily

Comments in Opposition

Pine Gate asserts that the Commission should not incorporate requirements into
the pro forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP that are already being addressed by NERC
through the standards development process, which will add new requirements related to
the vast majority of the modeling and performance issues identified in the NOPR.3204 In

disturbance reports. NERC notes that the IEEE standards are inherently not mandatory
unless a governing authority with jurisdiction adopts and enforces them and include many
recommended practices that could be deemed informational.3208 Accordingly, NERC
asserts that IEEE Standard 2800-2022 operates similar to NERC reliability guidelines,
although IEEE Standard 2800-2022 is only available upon purchase.
NERC recommends that the Commission explicitly integrate the requirements and
recommendations from IEEE Standard 2800-2022 into the pro forma interconnection
agreements.3209 Specifically, NERC contends that the Commission should prioritize the
disturbance ride through, active power–frequency control, reactive power–voltage
control, data sharing, and modeling provisions of IEEE Standard 2800-2022. However,
NERC states that some transmission system conditions may require inverter control
modes, settings, or protections that will not conform to IEEE Standard 2800-2022 regionwide expectations. NERC also argues that transmission providers should be permitted to
establish additional performance requirements for specific locations and instances beyond
region-wide requirements established under pro forma provisions, subject to transparency
and public notice.

Standard 1547 for small generating facilities.3210 EPRI asserts that these standards have
been developed through a rigorous process and provide for IBR performance that
supports system reliability while providing sufficient flexibility for RTOs/ISOs and
interconnection customers.3211 EPRI also notes that inverter manufacturers have publicly
stated that state-of-the-art equipment already has the majority of the capabilities required
by IEEE Standard 2800.
EPRI argues that the Commission should consider narrowly specifying ride
through requirements by reference to IEEE Standards 2800 and 1547; aligning all
applicable definitions proposed in the NOPR with those standards; and evaluating the
alignment of additional definitions or performance specifications with potential future
revisions of those standards.3212 EPRI asserts that failing to do so could create undue
technical barriers to IBRs, and that paraphrasing of IEEE standards, rather than directly
referencing the standards’ requirements, could lead to an inconsistent implementation of
the final rule in different regions with insufficient reliability benefits.3213

EPRI asserts that, if the Commission specifies its own ride through performance
requirements, an alternative but less preferred approach would be to use the precise
language and definitions as published in IEEE Standards 2800 and 1547.3214
EPRI argues that the NOPR proposal does not seem entirely aligned with the
NERC IBR guidelines and is not as clear as the applicable industry standards like IEEE
Standard 2800-2022.3215 EPRI also asserts that the Commission should consider what it
characterizes as significant improvements in IEEE Standard 2800 over the NERC
reliability guidelines. EPRI contends that the NERC IBR reliability guidelines cited in
the NOPR did not fully consider all technical and stakeholder concerns considered by
IEEE Standard 2800 and are therefore in contravention of the IEEE Standard 2800-2022
consensus requirements.3216
SEIA states that IBRs are currently capable of riding through disturbances and that
many developers have implemented controls to ensure they do so following the release of
the consensus-based IEEE standards.3217 SEIA argues that incorporating IEEE Standard

Feasibility of NOPR Proposal

Some commenters argue that the proposed requirement in the NOPR “to maintain
power production at pre-disturbance levels unless providing primary frequency response
or fast frequency response” is not feasible.3219 Invenergy asserts that, in order to increase
reactive power output to maintain system voltage, a generator would necessarily have to
reduce real power output: therefore, Invenergy requests that the NOPR proposal be
revised to clarify this potential inconsistency.3220 Clean Energy Associations and Public
Interest Organizations contend that a requirement to maintain active power injection at
pre-disturbance levels would lead to an undesirable response from generating facilities

response would be to shift some power output to prioritize reactive power.3221

Commission replace the requirement to maintain active power production with language
from NERC Reliability Standard PRC-024-3, which requires current injection and not
active power injection to continue at pre-disturbance levels.3223 Alternatively, Clean
Energy Associations and Invenergy suggest the proposed language could be made more
workable by only requiring a return to the pre-disturbance level of power production
following voltage recovery, subject to the energy availability of the resource, which
Clean Energy Associations explains would allow a generator to correctly shift from
active power to reactive power during the voltage disturbance.3224
CAISO requests that the Commission not require that inverters be able to provide
real power during a transitory disturbance.3225 CAISO states that, unlike synchronous
generating facilities, IBRs are current limited and generally operate at their maximum
output. CAISO argues that maintaining real power output at pre-disturbance levels
would likely inhibit a non-synchronous generating facility’s ability to provide reactive
power during a disturbance, and to help ensure reliability CAISO recommends removing

the real power requirements and requiring non-synchronous generating facilities to
provide reactive power at pre-disturbance levels. EPRI agrees that maintaining active
power at the pre-disturbance levels during and after the abnormal voltage period may not
be practical, given that voltage disturbances tend to be limited to a region relatively close
to the fault location, and is not aligned with IEEE Standard 2800-2022 or other
international requirements.3226 EPRI and NERC recommend that IBR plant performance
requirements should address active and/or reactive current during an abnormal voltage
condition and requirements for the restoration of active power output in the post-fault
period.3227
EPRI argues that the implementation of frequency and voltage protection relay
settings should not be exactly aligned with the NERC Reliability Standard PRC-024
curves but rather be based on the actual limits of equipment capability, with the objective
to avoid potential damages.3228
Ørsted argues that it is not possible to maintain real power production with
depressed voltage that is still within the no trip zone of NERC Reliability Standard
PRC-024-3, and explains that prioritizing reactive current during fault ride through mode
(even within the no trip zone) is instrumental to maintain reliability.3229 Ørsted

recommends replacing the reference to good utility practice in proposed article 9.7.3 of
the pro forma LGIA and instead rely on Order No. 842 and its definition of “Bulk-Power
System – Primary Frequency Response.”3230
NERC notes that conventional grid-following IBRs are current-limited devices,
and their active power output is voltage-dependent, making maintaining 100% of predisturbance active power while providing reactive power to support the bulk-power
system during the fault period not always feasible.3231 NERC recommends referring to
“controls that maintain pre-disturbance active current (Ip)” in addition to the provision of
reactive current (Iq) (i.e., reactive power support) rather than referring to “power.”3232

Invenergy asserts that the NOPR proposal should go beyond the pro forma
LGIA’s current requirements and apply evenly to all generating facilities, not just nonsynchronous generating facilities.3233 Similarly, Clean Energy Associations assert that

Associations assert that, to prevent undue discrimination, the Commission should either
proceed with a similar effort to require ride through performance from synchronous
generating facilities; or allow ride through performance exceptions for non-synchronous
generating facility trips caused by auxiliary equipment performance, which are a primary
cause of ride through failure for both synchronous and non-synchronous generating
facilities.
EPRI states that article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA could benefit from additional
modifications that differentiate between the ride through requirements for synchronous
and non-synchronous large generating facilities because the two technologies have
inherently different technical capabilities and operating principles.3235
Ørsted urges the Commission to take note of the differences between technologies
regarding their ability to ride through transmission system faults.3236 For example, Ørsted
states that it uses a plant controller for wind turbines that is frozen in fault ride through
mode and that controls aiding voltage recovery are performed by individual turbines until
voltage profile is back within a normal operating band of 90–110% of rated voltage.

Proposed Revisions to the Pro Forma
LGIA

Ørsted asserts that interconnection customers can only “ensure” ride through
capability of the generating and interconnection facilities per the definition in article 1 in
the pro forma LGIA. Ørsted contends that the Commission’s use of the term
“transmission system” in article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA is unclear in this context,
and thus Ørsted alleges that it will be difficult to demonstrate compliance. Accordingly,
Ørsted urges the Commission to use the term “generation and interconnection facilities”
instead of “transmission system” in article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA.3237
Ørsted states that, in case of severe voltage dip, IBRs may freeze in phase locked
loop, essentially holding the calculated angle of the external voltage at a certain value.3238
Ørsted argues that this makes IBR units not strictly synchronized with the transmission
system during this period.3239 Accordingly, Ørsted asks the Commission to remove the
phrase “stay synchronized” from article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA.

Requests for Clarification and Miscellaneous

NV Energy questions the ramifications of non-synchronous generating facilities
failing to maintain a composite power delivery at continuous rated power output at the
high side of the generator substation at a power factor within the range of 0.95 leading to
0.95 lagging.3240 NV Energy suggests in this circumstance the non-synchronous
generating facilities make a payment for failing to maintain the tariff-required composite
power delivery. NV Energy notes that there is a pending reactive power rulemaking and
inquires whether the industry should assume that payments for reactive power will be
addressed in that rulemaking.
Eversource requests that the Commission clarify that transmission providers may
include additional performance requirements in the LGIA appendices for nonsynchronous generating facilities that are necessary to ensure reliable interconnection in a
given area, such as harmonics or radio frequency interference.3241
Invenergy asserts that the Commission should not rely entirely on ride through and
other burdens on interconnection customers to address larger transmission system issues
that should be addressed through regional transmission planning processes.3242

Commission Determination

We adopt, with modifications, the NOPR proposal to revise article 9.7.3 of the pro
forma LGIA and article 1.5.7 of the pro forma SGIA to establish ride through
requirements during abnormal frequency conditions and voltage conditions within the
“no trip zone” defined by NERC Reliability Standard PRC-024-3 or successor mandatory
ride through reliability standards, as set forth in the modified pro forma LGIA language
discussed below. We modify the proposed requirements to acknowledge the physical
limitations of newly interconnecting non-synchronous generating facilities. In the
NOPR, the Commission stated that compliance with the NOPR proposal would be largely
a control settings issue and may not be costly. We are persuaded by comments that
contend that compliance with the NOPR proposal would be infeasible for certain types of
inverters and non-synchronous generating facilities, and thus make modifications to
address these concerns.
Based on the record, we affirm the Commission’s preliminary finding in the
NOPR that the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA fail to account for a non-

synchronous generating facility’s ability to engage in momentary cessation. We note that
the physical characteristics of synchronous generating facilities result in such facilities
continuing to inject electric current during transmission system disturbances, consistent
with the existing requirements to remain “connected to and synchronized with the
[t]ransmission [s]ystem” as required by the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA. As a
result of these requirements, synchronous generating facilities continue to inject current
during such disturbances, such that services provided supporting transmission system
reliability are not disrupted during such events. However, the existing pro forma LGIA
and pro forma SGIA do not currently require non-synchronous generating facilities to be
capable of continuing to inject current in a manner comparable to synchronous generating
facilities during system disturbances. As a result, non-synchronous generating facilities
often cease injecting current during transmission system disturbances through
“momentary cessation.” We agree with commenters that such behavior by nonsynchronous generating facilities can pose significant risk to the reliability of the bulkpower system, as documented in several reports and NERC-issued alerts.3244
Moreover, without requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities to
remain connected to and synchronized with the transmission system, and not to engage in

momentary cessation, interconnection studies may not be able to accurately model
expected behavior and identify the appropriate interconnection facilities and network
upgrades to accommodate the interconnection request, resulting in an inaccurate
assignment of interconnection costs. As a result, we find that the lack of comparable
requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities to have the capability to remain
“connected to and synchronized with the [t]ransmission [s]ystem” in the pro forma LGIA
and pro forma SGIA results in rates that are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly
discriminatory or preferential.
While a number of commenters object to the specific provisions proposed in the
NOPR to resolve this issue, addressed further below, no commenter disagrees that there
is a lack of requirements in the pro forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA regarding the use
of momentary cessation by non-synchronous generating facilities. Moreover, no
commenter disputes the technical ability of non-synchronous generating facilities to
continue to inject current during transmission system disturbances.
Specifically, we require that during abnormal frequency conditions and voltage
conditions within the “no trip zone” defined by NERC Reliability Standard PRC-024-3 or
successor mandatory ride through reliability standards, the non-synchronous generating
facility must ensure that, within any physical limitations of the generating facility, its
control and protection settings are configured or set to: (1) continue active power
production during disturbance and post disturbance periods at pre-disturbance levels

unless providing primary frequency response or fast frequency response;3245 (2) minimize
reductions in active power and remain within dynamic voltage and current limits, if
reactive power priority mode is enabled, unless providing primary frequency response or
fast frequency response; (3) not artificially limit dynamic reactive power capability
during disturbances; and (4) return to pre-disturbance active power levels without
artificial ramp rate limits if active power is reduced, unless providing primary frequency
response or fast frequency response.
In comparison to the NOPR proposal, this language, as adopted, provides nonsynchronous generating facilities, within any physical limitations of the generating
facility, the ability to reduce active power production in order to prioritize reactive power
output in support of transmission system voltage.3246 This language also recognizes that
such facilities may not be able to ride through disturbances with the same performance as
synchronous generating facilities without costly equipment modification. However, this
language requires non-synchronous generating facilities, within any physical limitations
of the generating facility, to configure or set their facilities to ride through disturbances

3245

Fast frequency response is defined as power injected to (or absorbed from) the
grid in response to changes in measured or observed frequency during the arresting phase
of a frequency excursion event to improve the frequency nadir or initial rate-of-change of
frequency. See Fast Frequency Response Concepts and Bulk Power System Reliability

and continue to support system reliability. This language is consistent with suggestions
by a number of commenters that the final rule recognize that non-synchronous generating
facilities cannot provide both real and reactive power at pre-disturbance levels during a
disturbance,3247 allow for the prioritization of reactive power,3248 and address restoration
of active power output in the post-fault period.3249
The adopted language requires non-synchronous generating facilities, within any
physical limitations of the generating facility, to configure or set their facilities to be able
to ride through disturbances and continuing to support system reliability. Specifically,
while grid-forming inverters are available, they are not widely commercially deployed
due to lack of experience, cost, or other factors.3250 Given the existing technical
capabilities of non-synchronous generating facilities, we agree with commenters that the
NOPR proposal requiring active power to be maintained at pre-disturbance levels during
a system disturbance in all instances may not be feasible, or preferrable from a reliability

perspective. For example, we agree there may be instances where the injection of
reactive power should be prioritized to maintain reliability during a system disturbance,
which may require non-synchronous generating facilities to temporarily reduce their
injection of active power.3251 As a result, we adopt a modified NOPR proposal to
accommodate existing technical capabilities and physical limitations of non-synchronous
generating facilities, by providing for reductions in active power to prioritize reactive
power while prohibiting non-synchronous generating facilities from configuring or
setting their control and protection settings to effectively artificially limit such resources
below their actual capability.
We also adopt the NOPR proposal to revise article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA to
include in the definition of “ride through” the ability of the large generating facility to
stay connected to and synchronized with the transmission system during system
disturbances within under-voltage and over-voltage conditions. This revision ensures
that large generating facilities are capable of remaining connected to and synchronized
with the transmission system, consistent with the other ride through requirements adopted
here and similar requirements in the pro forma SGIA.
Some commenters request that the Commission either incorporate IEEE Standard
2800-2022 by reference, or explicitly incorporate this standard’s performance
requirements into the pro forma LGIA. Although we acknowledge the value of IEEE
2800-2022, we decline to incorporate it by reference. IEEE 2800-2022 was developed

for a different purpose; it is a voluntary guideline that uses discretionary terms (e.g.,
“may,” “should,” “can,” or “upon agreement”). It is unclear whether IEEE 2800-2022
would adequately address the problem identified by the Commission because the
Commission would have limited authority to enforce these discretionary provisions.
Invenergy and Clean Energy Associations assert that the Commission should
impose similar ride through requirements on synchronous generating facilities.
Alternatively, Clean Energy Associations assert that, to prevent undue discrimination, the
Commission should allow ride through performance exceptions for non-synchronous
generating facility trips caused by auxiliary equipment performance, which are a primary
cause of ride through failure for both synchronous and non-synchronous generating
facilities. We do not believe that imposing similar ride through requirements on
synchronous generating facilities is necessary because the physical characteristics of
synchronous generating facilities result in such facilities continuing to inject electric
current during transmission system disturbances, i.e., do not allow for momentary
cessation.
We also decline to grant Clean Energy Associations’ alternative request because
we find that a ride through exception for non-synchronous generating facility trips caused
by auxiliary equipment performance is not needed. As NERC has noted, protection on
auxiliary equipment for non-synchronous resources, other than the generator-connected
unit auxiliary transformer, is already exempted from the requirements of NERC
Reliability Standard PRC-024-3 specifically because protection for such auxiliary

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

equipment does not cause a resource to trip or cease injecting current.3252 We do not
believe that auxiliary equipment performance is considered a physical limitation of a nonsynchronous generating facility such that control and protection settings can be
configured or set to reduce active power production during disturbances, and therefore no
exception is needed.
Pine Gate asserts that the Commission should not adopt requirements to the pro
forma LGIP and pro forma SGIP that are already being addressed by NERC through the
standards development process. We disagree because adding such provisions to the pro
forma LGIA and pro forma SGIA will require all newly interconnecting generating
facilities to abide by such provisions regardless of whether such newly interconnecting
generating facilities are outside the bounds of NERC’s jurisdiction. As such, we find that
this modified reform can holistically address the identified issues alongside the NERC
standards.
NV Energy raises questions about the ramifications of non-synchronous
generating facilities failing to maintain reactive power and whether the Commission is
proposing any changes to reactive power compensation. We clarify that the Commission
is not proposing changes to reactive power compensation in this proceeding.

transmission system issues that should be addressed through regional transmission
planning processes. The need to establish interconnection requirements for generating
facilities to “remain connected to and synchronized with the [t]ransmission [s]ystem”
during system disturbances is properly addressed in this proceeding that deals with
reforming the interconnection processes for newly interconnecting generating facilities.
Regarding Invenergy’s arguments that larger transmission system issues need to be
addressed in the regional transmission planning processes, we note that while reforms to
regional transmission planning are outside the scope of this proceeding, the Commission
is considering addressing regional transmission planning and cost allocation in another
pending proceeding.3253
EPRI argues that the grandfathering of existing non-synchronous generating
facilities is an important consideration that should be addressed through Commission and
NERC requirements and suggests that the Commission could add a procedure and criteria
for a transmission provider to waive the grandfathering rule and require retrofits of
existing non-synchronous generating facilities at the time of plant changes or require
upgrades to meet the specified performance and modeling requirements. We decline to
add the requested procedure. The final rule changes to the pro forma LGIA and pro

effective date of the transmission provider’s filing in compliance with this final rule.
Both the NOPR proposal and the adopted language were intended to be achieved through
changes to control settings at minimal cost for current inverter technology; it did not
contemplate imposing potentially significant retrofit or equipment costs on existing nonsynchronous generating facilities.3254
Ørsted requests clarification on how the NOPR proposal will affect a plant
controller for wind turbines that is frozen in fault ride through mode and control actions
aiding voltage recovery are performed by individual turbines until the voltage profile
returns to the normal operating band of 90-110% of rated voltage. We note that the
reforms, as adopted, apply to a non-synchronous generating facility as a whole, rather
than to any individual component within the facility. As long as the non-synchronous
generating facility as a whole meets the ride through requirements, it does not matter
which part of the facility is controlling the generating facility’s output.
Ørsted also notes that non-synchronous generating facilities may freeze in phase
locked loop during disturbances, making them not strictly synchronized with the
transmission system. Ørsted asks the Commission to remove the phrase “stay
synchronized” from article 9.7.3 of the pro forma LGIA. We decline to do so because
the NOPR did not propose to revise this phrase and this final rule establishes the specific
ride through requirements for newly interconnecting non-synchronous generating
facilities.

Applicability of Ride Through Requirements
i.

Need for Reform and NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission noted that generating facilities interconnecting
under the pro forma LGIA that are subject to reliability standards are required to ride
through frequency and voltage disturbance events, while generating facilities that are not
already subject to reliability standards are not, despite the fact that all generating facilities
newly interconnecting under the pro forma LGIA are technically capable of riding
through disturbances.3255 The Commission explained that there is an existing gap in the
applicability of ride through requirements for large generating facilities with a capacity
above 20 MW and with a gross plant/facility aggregate nameplate rating of 75 MVA or
less.3256 The Commission preliminarily found that the pro forma LGIA requirements
could result in unduly discriminatory or preferential treatment due to this gap in the

applicability of ride through performance requirements to similarly situated generating
facilities.
The Commission proposed to revise the pro forma LGIA to require that all newly
interconnecting large generating facilities provide ride through capability consistent with
any standards and guidelines that are applied to other generating facilities in the
balancing authority area on a comparable basis.3257 The Commission noted that the
proposed reform is consistent with existing language in article 1.5.7 of the pro forma
SGIA that requires newly interconnecting small generating facilities to ride through
abnormal frequency and voltage events and not disconnect during such events.
In addition to the substantive changes, the Commission proposed to replace the
term “applicable reliability council” with “electric reliability organization,” and replace
the term “control area” with “balancing authority area” throughout the pro forma LGIP
and pro forma LGIA. The Commission explained that these proposed replacements
reflect updated terminology.3258

but it does not include the applicable regional entity, which Enel asserts should be
included because the regional entity may have approved the regional reliability
standards.3260
iii.

Commission Determination

We adopt the NOPR proposal to revise the pro forma LGIA to require that all
newly interconnecting large generating facilities provide frequency and voltage ride
through capability consistent with any standards and guidelines that are applied to other
generating facilities in the balancing authority area on a comparable basis. Adopting this
reform enables the Commission to address an existing gap in the applicability of ride
through requirements for large generating facilities with a capacity above 20 MW and
with a gross plant/facility aggregate nameplate rating 75 MVA or less.
Based on the record before us, we confirm the Commission’s preliminary finding
in the NOPR that the pro forma LGIP is unduly discriminatory or preferential insofar as
generating facilities that are not already subject to reliability standards are not required to
ride through frequency and voltage disturbance events, despite being technically capable
of doing so. We note that no commenter opposes this reform.
We also adopt the NOPR proposal to replace the term “applicable reliability
council” with “electric reliability organization,” and the term “control area” with
“balancing authority area,” throughout the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA. In
response to Enel’s concerns, we note that, while regional reliability standards may be

developed by the applicable regional entity, the Commission has found that regional
reliability standards are considered part of the electric reliability organization’s set of
reliability standards and are therefore covered under the proposed definition.3261

Commission Determination

We consider the comments referenced in the section above to be beyond the scope
of this proceeding. The Commission proposed specific reforms in the NOPR, to which
commenters have responded and for which a record has been established. Even for those
issues tangentially connected to NOPR proposals, the record here is inadequate to support
their full consideration. Further, we consider issues regarding the coordination of
transmission planning with generator interconnection to be beyond the scope of this
rulemaking. We note that the Commission proposed reforms related to coordination
between regional transmission planning and cost allocation and generator interconnection

Compliance Procedures
A.

NOPR Proposal

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require each transmission provider to
submit a compliance filing within 180 days of the effective date of the final rule revising
its LGIP, LGIA, SGIP, and SGIA, as necessary, to demonstrate that it meets the
requirements set forth in the final rule.3298 The Commission also proposed to permit
appropriate entities to seek an “independent entity variation” or a “regional reliability
variation” from the proposed requirements.3299 The Commission further noted that some
transmission providers may have provisions in their existing LGIPs, LGIAs, SGIPs, and
SGIAs subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction that the Commission has previously
deemed to be consistent with or superior to the pro forma LGIP, pro forma LGIA, pro
forma SGIP, and/or pro forma SGIA or permissible under the independent entity
variation standard or regional reliability variation standard. Where these provisions
would be modified by the final rule, the Commission proposed to require transmission
providers to either comply with the final rule or demonstrate that these previously
approved variations continue to meet the “consistent with or superior to” and “regional
reliability variation” standard for non-RTO/ISO transmission providers and the
independent entity variation standard for RTOs/ISOs.

The Commission explained that it would assess whether each compliance filing
satisfies the proposed requirements and issue additional orders as necessary to ensure that
each transmission provider meets the requirements of the final rule.3300
The Commission also proposed that non-public utility transmission providers
would have to adopt the proposed requirements as a condition of maintaining the status of
their safe harbor tariff or otherwise satisfying the reciprocity requirement of Order No.

Compliance Filing Deadline

Consumers Energy and NRECA support the proposed requirement for
transmission providers to submit compliance filings within 180 days of the effective date
of a final rule in this proceeding.3302 NRECA states that 180 days is a reasonable amount
of time for transmission providers to assess their generation portfolios and for
interconnection customers to gauge project viability and withdraw those interconnection
requests that are not commercially ready.3303 Consumers Energy suggests that the
Commission require RTOs/ISOs to justify any individual extensions for compliance

filings.3304 NRECA asks the Commission to waive any existing withdrawal penalties
during the period between a final rule and compliance filings to encourage the rapid
withdrawal of speculative interconnection requests and the pursuit of ready
interconnection requests.3305
Some commenters argue that the Commission should provide a longer time period
for compliance filings because the scope and complexity of the reforms will require
substantial time and resources and will involve lengthy stakeholder processes.3306 Some
commenters also note that transmission providers will need to balance other priorities
while developing compliance filings, such as administering the interconnection queue
and pursuing transmission planning reforms.3307 Some commenters state that the 180-day
period will be difficult for large, multi-state RTOs/ISOs that must develop large-scale
tariff revisions in conjunction with large stakeholder communities.3308 EEI suggests a

PJM asks the Commission to hold its compliance filing obligation in abeyance
until PJM completes the transition mechanism from its recent interconnection queue
reform in Docket No. ER22-2110-000, which was the result of an 18-month stakeholder
process.3311 PJM states that, if it is required to submit a compliance filing during the
transition process, that will cast a cloud over the transition process while the request for
an independent entity variation works through a prolonged regulatory process, bringing
into doubt interconnection agreements finalized as part of the transition and further
aggravating backlogs.3312 PJM explains that, when it completes this transition process, it
can evaluate whether to adopt the final rule’s reforms or demonstrate that its reforms are
superior.3313 PJM asserts that such a “staged” compliance process aligns with past
Commission decisions and would bring more certainty to interconnection customers.3314

in the process of adopting some of the NOPR proposals or similar processes targeting the
challenges cited in the NOPR.3316 Many commenters ask the Commission to ensure the

In contrast, other commenters request that the Commission apply a new standard
when evaluating variations from the pro forma requirements.3321 OMS asks the
Commission to allow transmission providers initiating their own stakeholder-supported
interconnection reforms to continue developing regionally appropriate solutions upon a
compliance showing of “substantial conformity” with the final rule requirements.3322
MISO argues that the Commission should create an “independent entity presumption of
reasonableness,” under which the Commission would rebuttably presume that any
previous, proactive RTO/ISO reform that addresses the objectives of a final rule
requirement (but does not conform to every detail) is eligible for an independent entity
variation, unless an intervenor demonstrates that the previous reform does not provide the
benefit that technical compliance with the final rule would.3323 NextEra also states that
requiring transmission providers and stakeholders to have to justify whether their past
reform initiatives match the Commission’s new rule would likely waste time and
resources.3324
Similarly, the Early Adopters Coalition ask the Commission to rebuttably presume
that first-ready, first-served interconnection queue reforms already in place continue to be
just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory and consistent with or superior to the

pro forma requirements.3325 Further, the Early Adopters Coalition and Indicated PJM
TOs argue that there is an insufficient legal foundation under FPA section 206 to
conclude that the Early Adopters Coalition’s tariffs are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly
discriminatory or preferential because the Commission’s FPA section 206 finding only
speaks to the generic pro forma requirements, while many transmission providers’ tariffs
have already departed from those requirements.3326 Indicated PJM TOs state that the
Commission lacks the authority under FPA section 206 to require modification of a tariff
that does not include the elements determined in the final rule to be unjust and
unreasonable or unduly discriminatory.3327
The Early Adopters Coalition also express concern that the proposed reforms
would result in a higher burden of proof to justify departures from the pro forma
requirements in future filings and signal that the Commission may not accept further
incremental improvements; therefore, they ask the Commission to clarify that the final
rule will not stifle their ability to improve their existing tariffs.3328
PacifiCorp expresses concern that the NOPR proposal could disrupt some of
PacifiCorp’s unique processes, including its inclusion of small generating facilities in the

Commission-jurisdictional interconnection process into its state-level interconnection

CREA and NewSun contest PacifiCorp’s and the other Early Adopters Coalition’s
argument that the Commission’s approval of their LGIPs under FPA section 205 exempts
them from any reforms adopted in a final rule in this proceeding because the Commission
has an obligation under FPA section 206 to remedy unjust, unreasonable, and unduly
discriminatory or preferential practices.3330 CREA and NewSun also note that neither
utility- nor region-specific findings are necessary in a generic rulemaking; rather, the
Commission can rely on basic economic theory and generic factual predictions.3331
CREA and NewSun also assert that the sole authority cited by the Early Adopters
Coalition, Emera Maine v. FERC, is inapposite, because it involved a challenge to a
specific transmission owners’ base return on equity, not a nationwide rulemaking.3332

Xcel asks the Commission to state in the final rule that there is not just one just
and reasonable approach to interconnection reform.3334 Xcel requests that the
Commission confirm that alternative approaches used by RTOs/ISOs that achieve the
policy goals of prioritizing ready interconnection requests and increasing the speed of
interconnection queue processing are consistent with and superior to the pro forma LGIP,
instead of using the independent entity variation standard when approving those
RTOs/ISOs’ compliance filings. Xcel explains that its preferred approach would allow
non-RTOs/ISOs to replicate processes that are working efficiently in RTOs/ISOs.
ACORE expresses concern that too much flexibility would detract from the
benefits of a final rule.3335 ACORE explains that a consistent minimum set of
requirements and common interconnection study methods and best practices is essential
across all transmission providers.

Reciprocity Tariffs

APPA-LPPC and NRECA seek clarification on the NOPR’s statements regarding
reciprocity tariffs.3336 They point out that Commission precedent allows non-public
utilities to satisfy the reciprocity requirement of Order No. 888 through one of three
means: (1) providing service to a public utility transmission provider under a safe harbor
tariff; (2) providing service under a bilateral agreement; or (3) seeking waiver.3337
APPA-LPPC and NRECA explain that the NOPR’s statement that non-public utility
transmission providers “will have to adopt the requirements of this Proposed Rule as a
condition of maintaining the status of their safe harbor tariff or otherwise satisfying the
reciprocity requirement of Order No. 888” could be read to suggest that the other ways of
satisfying the reciprocity requirement no longer exist.3338 APPA-LPPC and NRECA ask
the Commission to clarify that non-public utilities will still be able to satisfy reciprocity
requirements through bilateral arrangements or waiver.

Effective Date

MISO asks the Commission to make the reforms effective when orders on
compliance are issued, rather than on the final rule’s effective date, to avoid retroactive
implementation of the proposed reforms and disruption in administering interconnection

queues.3339 MISO explains that an effective date prior to the date of accepted compliance
provisions would require a transmission provider to file new agreements with pending
language, which means that transmission providers will need to file interconnection
agreements and service agreements instead of using the electronic quarterly report (EQR)
process.

Miscellaneous

SoCal Edison states that the final rule should not automatically apply to a
wholesale distribution access tariff without further consideration in a separate
rulemaking.3340 SoCal Edison argues that the Commission should allow entities to align
distribution-level tariffs with corresponding transmission-level tariffs to avoid gaming of
interconnection locations and contends that the changes proposed in this NOPR are too
extensive to apply to the unique characteristics of the distribution system.3341 SoCal
Edison states that the Commission has previously confirmed that reforms to the LGIP and
LGIA are not required for the interconnection agreements under the wholesale
distribution access tariff, and different processes, interconnection costs, and penalties
could introduce new challenges for wholesale distribution providers and interconnection
efficiencies that have not been addressed in the NOPR.

Commission Determination

We modify the deadline for transmission providers to submit a compliance filing
to adopt the requirements of this final rule as revisions to the LGIP, LGIA, SGIP, and
SGIA in their tariffs. We require the submission of such compliance filings within 90
calendar days of the publication date of this final rule in the Federal Register rather than
the proposed 180 days from the effective date of the final rule. We believe that it is
important to implement this final rule in a timely manner, given the pressing need to
reform the interconnection processes, as discussed in this final rule. On the Commissionapproved effective date of the transmission provider’s compliance filing with this final
rule, the transmission provider will commence the transition study process.3342 After the
conclusion of the transition study process, the transmission provider will begin the first
standard cluster study process,3343 and in its compliance filing, the transmission provider
will indicate the number of calendar days after the conclusion of the transition study
process when it will begin this first standard cluster study process (e.g., 30 calendar days
after the conclusion of the transition study process).3344 By setting a 90-calendar day
compliance filing deadline, the Commission may be in a position to act on the filings
sooner, which will allow transmission providers to commence the transition process and

We note that this standard cluster study process is distinct from the transitional
cluster study process described above. See supra Section III.A.7.c.

progress to the first standard cluster study process earlier, and thereby implement the
reforms contemplated by this final rule earlier rather than later.
We note that 90 days is longer than the 60 days provided for compliance with
Order No. 2003. In their compliance filings for Order No. 2003, transmission providers
were required to adopt the pro forma LGIP and pro forma LGIA. Under this final rule,
transmission providers are required to revise the LGIP, LGIA, SGIP, and SGIA in their
tariffs, but are not provided significant discretion as to the terms of those documents,
except for those who request deviations, as discussed below. While we recognize that the
compliance filings for some transmission providers will entail more complexity, we
believe that 90 calendar days should be sufficient time to prepare and submit even the
more complex compliance filings. Further, the need to implement the reforms set forth in
this final rule earlier rather than later outweighs the concerns raised about the timing of
the compliance filing deadline.
Consistent with Order Nos. 888, 890, 2003, 2006, and 845, we adopt the NOPR
proposal to continue to apply the “consistent with or superior to” standard when
considering proposals from non-RTO/ISO transmission providers to deviate from the
requirements of this final rule.3345 Consistent with Order Nos. 2003, 2006, and 845, we

when considering such proposals from RTOs/ISOs.3346 Consistent with Order Nos. 888,
890, 2003, 2006, and 845, we adopt the NOPR proposal to continue to allow nonRTO/ISO transmission providers to use the regional differences rationale to seek
variations made in response to established reliability requirements.3347 In this final rule,
we make no changes to the standards used to judge requested variations, as described in
Order Nos. 888, 890, 2003, 2006, and 845.
We reject requests to presume that any transmission provider’s tariff meets the
requirements of this final rule. We recognize that many transmission providers have
adopted or are in the process of adopting similar reforms to those adopted in this final
rule. We do not intend to disrupt these ongoing transition processes or stifle further
innovation. On compliance, transmission providers can propose deviations from the

with or superior to the pro forma LGIA or pro forma LGIP).

requirements adopted in this final rule – including deviations seeking to minimize
interference with ongoing transition plans – and demonstrate how those deviations satisfy
the standards discussed above, which the Commission will consider on a case-by-case
basis.
We disagree with commenters that suggest that FPA section 206 requires the
Commission to make findings specific to each transmission provider’s tariff in this final
rule to require transmission providers to comply with the requirements of this final rule.
As some commenters recognize, neither utility- nor region-specific findings are necessary
in a generic rulemaking.3348
In response to commenters that prefer regional reform over generic one-size-fitsall reform, we note that transmission providers may seek the appropriate variation on
compliance provided the reason for the variation is sufficiently justified and may
continue to propose solutions to interconnection issues under FPA section 205. However,
given the nation-wide need for reforms to ensure that interconnection customers are able
to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely
manner, as well as prevent undue discrimination, we believe that a generic rulemaking is
appropriate, as explained above in Section II and throughout this final rule.
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that non-public utility transmission providers
“will have to adopt the requirements of this Proposed Rule as a condition of maintaining
the status of their safe harbor tariff or otherwise satisfying the reciprocity requirement of

Order No. 888.”3349 As requested by NRECA and APPA-LPPC,3350 we clarify that this
final rule does not modify the Commission’s reciprocity requirement in Order Nos. 888
and 2003.3351 Thus, while a non-public utility’s adoption of the proposed LGIP/LGIA
and SGIP/SGIA changes is a condition of maintaining a safe harbor tariff,3352 non-public
utilities may still use a request for waiver or bilateral agreements to satisfy the reciprocity
requirement of Order No. 888-A.3353
With respect to MISO’s comments, as explained below, this final rule is effective
[INSERT DATE 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL
REGISTER]. This final rule will be effective as described above; however, the pro
forma LGIP, pro forma LGIA, pro forma SGIP, and pro forma SGIP requirements in
transmission providers’ tariffs will not be effective until the Commission-approved

other words, interconnection customers seeking to interconnect to MISO’s transmission
system will not be subject to the requirements of this final rule until the Commission
issues an order on MISO’s compliance filing with a Commission-approved effective date
for MISO’s tariff revisions.
In response to SoCal Edison’s request for the Commission to clarify that the
reforms described herein will not automatically apply to wholesale distribution access
tariffs, we note that in Order No. 2003, the Commission stated that the pro forma LGIA
and pro forma LGIP adopted in that final rule apply to a request to interconnect to a
public utility’s “distribution” facilities used to transmit electric energy in interstate
commerce on behalf of a wholesale purchaser pursuant to a Commission-filed open
access transmission tariff.3354 To the extent that SoCal Edison has concerns about its
specific wholesale distribution access tariff, this is a matter better suited to SoCal
Edison’s compliance filing.3355

3354

See Order No. 2003, 104 FERC ¶ 61,103 at P 804; id. P 803 (some lowervoltage facilities are “local distribution” facilities not under our jurisdiction, but some are
used for jurisdictional service such as carrying power to a wholesale power customer for
resale and are included in a public utility’s open access transmission tariff (although in
some instances, there is a separate open access transmission tariff rate for using them,
sometimes called a wholesale distribution rate.)); Order No. 2003-A, 106 FERC ¶ 61,220

Information Collection Statement
The information collection requirements contained in this final rule are subject to

review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under section 3507(d) of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.3356 OMB’s regulations require approval of certain
information collection requirements imposed by agency rules.3357 Respondents subject to
the filing requirements of this final rule will not be penalized for failing to respond to the
collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid OMB
control number.
The reforms adopted in this final rule revise the Commission’s standard large
generator interconnection procedures and agreements (i.e., the pro forma LGIP and pro
forma LGIA) and the Commission’s standard small generator interconnection procedures
and agreement (i.e., the pro forma SGIP and pro forma SGIA) that every public utility
transmission provider is required to include in their tariff under section 35.28 of the

pro forma LGIP into its wholesale distribution access tariff. See S. Cal. Edison Co.,

Commission’s regulations.3358 This final rule requires each transmission provider to
amend the standard large generator interconnection procedures and agreement and the
standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement in its tariff to
implement the reforms adopted in this final rule, which are intended to ensure that the
generator interconnection process is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or
preferential. These provisions affect the following collections of information: FERC516, Electric Rate Schedules and Tariff Filings (Control No. 1902-0096); and FERC516A, Standardization of Small Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures
(Control No. 1902-0203).
In the NOPR, the Commission solicited comments on: the Commission’s need for
this information; whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the
burden estimates; ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected or retained; and any suggested methods for minimizing respondents’ burden.
In response to comments on the NOPR,3359 we note that this information collection
statement estimates only those burdens3360 to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or

Indicated PJM TOs state that the NOPR did not attempt to quantify the
administrative burden for the transmission provider’s staff to perform the tasks required
by the proposed reforms, and SPP offered an estimated range of its potential costs of

Summary of the Revisions to the Collection of Information due to the final rule in
Docket No. RM22-14-000:
FERC-516: This final rule revises the Commission’s pro forma LGIP and pro
forma LGIA (and thus requires each public utility to amend its LGIP and LGIA) to
ensure that interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system
in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, and prevent undue discrimination.
As illustrated in the table below, most reforms affect the pro forma LGIP and pro forma
LGIA.
FERC-516A: Among other requirements, this final rule amends the
Commission’s standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement (i.e.,
the pro forma SGIP and pro forma SGIA) regarding evaluation of alternative
transmission technologies, modeling required for accurate interconnection studies, and
maintenance of power production during abnormal frequency conditions and certain
voltage conditions.
Title: Electric Rate Schedules and Tariff Filings (FERC-516) and Standardization
of Small Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures (FERC-516A).
Action: Revision of collections of information in accordance with Docket No.
RM22-14-000.

OMB Control Nos.: 1902-0096 (FERC-516) and 1902-0203 (FERC-516A).
Respondents: Public utility transmission providers, including RTOs/ISOs.
Frequency of Information Collection: One time during Year 1. Multiple times
during subsequent years.
Necessity of Information: The reforms in this final rule ensure that
interconnection customers are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a
reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner, and prevent undue discrimination. The
reforms are intended to ensure that the generator interconnection process is just,
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
Internal Review: We have reviewed the reforms that impose information
collection burdens and have determined that such reforms are necessary. These
requirements conform to the Commission’s need for efficient information collection,
communication, and management within the energy industry. We have specific,
objective support for the burden estimates associated with the information collection
requirements.
Public Reporting Burden: Our estimate of the number of reporting entities is based
on the number of transmission providers that submitted compliance filings to the
Commission in response to Order No. 845, which is the Commission’s most recent
rulemaking that required transmission providers to revise their generator interconnection
procedures and agreements, and Order No. 881, which is the Commission’s most recent
major rulemaking adopting reforms to the pro forma tariff. As such, we estimate that 44

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 1136 -

transmission providers, including RTOs/ISOs, will be subject to this rulemaking. The
burden and cost estimates below are based on (1) the initial need for transmission
providers to file revised versions of the standard interconnection procedures and
agreements in Year 1 and (2) ongoing information collection activities in connection with
reporting and disclosure requirements in subsequent years. For many reforms, we
estimate no ongoing information collection burden because there is either no information
collection aspect of the reform or the requirements would merely supplant existing ones.
The Commission estimates that the final rule in Docket No. RM22-14-000 will
adjust the burden and cost of FERC-516 and FERC-516A as follows:

In this final rule, after accounting for the adjustments and inputs noted above,
updated labor costs, and reforms not being adopted, the Commission used the numbers
provided in the NOPR for all reforms being adopted.
Interested persons may obtain information on the reporting requirements by
contacting Ellen Brown, Office of the Executive Director, Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 888 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 via email
(DataClearance@ferc.gov) or telephone ((202) 502-8663).
VI.

Environmental Analysis
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an

Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may have a significant adverse effect
on the human environment.3363 We conclude that neither an Environmental Assessment
nor an Environmental Impact Statement is required for this final rule under

3363

Regulations Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, Order No.
486, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles 1986-1990 ¶ 30,783
(1987) (cross-referenced at 41 FERC ¶ 61,284).

§ 380.4(a)(15) of the Commission’s regulations, which provides a categorical exemption
for approval of actions under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA relating to the filing of
schedules containing all rates and charges for the transmission or sale of electric energy
subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction, plus the classification, practices, contracts, and
regulations that affect rates, charges, classification, and services.3364
VII.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 19803365 requires a description and analysis of

proposed and final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) sets the threshold
for what constitutes a small business. Under SBA’s size standards,3366 transmission
providers and RTOs/ISOs fall under the category of Electric Bulk Power Transmission
and Control (NAICS code 221121), that has a size threshold of under 950 employees
(including the entity and its associates).3367

3364

18 CFR 380.4(a)(15) (2022).

3365

5 U.S.C. 601-612.

3366

13 CFR 121.201 (2022).

3367

The RFA definition of “small entity” refers to the definition provided in the
Small Business Act, which defines a “small business concern” as a business that is
independently owned and operated and that is not dominant in its field of operation. The
Small Business Administration’s regulations define the threshold for a small Electric
Bulk Power Transmission and Control entity (NAICS code 221121) to be 950 employees
(“the maximum allowed for a concern and its affiliates to be considered small”). See
13 CFR 121.201 (2022); see also 5 U.S.C. 601(3) (citing to Section 3 of the Small
Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632).

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

We estimate that there are 44 transmission providers affected by the reforms
proposed in this final rule. Furthermore, we estimate that 6 of the 44 total transmission
providers, approximately 14% (rounded), are small entities.
We estimate that one-time costs (in Year 1) associated with the reforms required
by this final rule for one transmission provider (as shown in the table above) would be
$70,980. Following Year 1, we estimate that the annual ongoing costs for one
transmission provider would be $3,640. According to SBA guidance, the determination
of significance of impact “should be seen as relative to the size of the business, the size of
the competitor’s business, and the impact the regulation has on larger competitors.”3368
We do not consider the estimated cost to be a significant economic impact. As a result,
we certify that the reforms proposed in this final rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

[An ]Interconnection Customer shall submit to Transmission Provider, during a Cluster
Request Window, an Interconnection Request in the form of Appendix 1 to this LGIP, an
application fee of $5,000, and a refundable study deposit of[$10,000]:
a. $35,000 plus $1,000 per MW for Interconnection Requests ≥ 20 MW < 80
MW, or;
b. $150,000 for Interconnection Requests ≥ 80 MW < 200 MW; or
c. $250,000 for Interconnection Requests ≥ 200 MW.
Transmission Provider shall apply the study deposit toward the cost of the Cluster [an
Interconnection Feasibility]Study Process.
3.1.2 Submission.
Interconnection Customer shall submit a separate Interconnection Request for each site
[and may submit multiple Interconnection Requests for a single site. Interconnection
Customer must submit a deposit with each Interconnection Request even when more than
one request is submitted for a single site]. Where multiple Generating Facilities share a
site, Interconnection Customer(s) may submit separate Interconnection Requests or a
single Interconnection Request. An Interconnection Request to evaluate one site at two
different voltage levels shall be treated as two Interconnection Requests.
At Interconnection Customer’s option, Transmission Provider and Interconnection
Customer will identify alternative Point(s) of Interconnection and configurations at [the]a
Scoping Meeting within the Customer Engagement Window to evaluate in this process
and attempt to eliminate alternatives in a reasonable fashion given resources and
information available. Interconnection Customer will select the definitive Point[(s)] of
Interconnection to be studied no later than the execution of the [Interconnection
Feasibility Study Agreement.]Cluster Study Agreement. For purposes of clustering
Interconnection Requests, Transmission Provider may propose changes to the requested
Point of Interconnection to facilitate efficient interconnection of Interconnection
Customers at common Point(s) of Interconnection. Transmission Provider shall notify
Interconnection Customers in writing of any intended changes to the requested Point of
Interconnection within the Customer Engagement Window, and the Point of
Interconnection shall only change upon mutual agreement.
Transmission Provider shall have a process in place to consider requests for
Interconnection Service below the Generating Facility Capacity. These requests for
Interconnection Service shall be studied at the level of Interconnection Service requested
for purposes of Interconnection Facilities, Network Upgrades, and associated costs, but
may be subject to other studies at the full Generating Facility Capacity to ensure safety
and reliability of the system, with the study costs borne by [the]Interconnection
Customer. If after the additional studies are complete, Transmission Provider determines

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 17 -

that additional Network Upgrades are necessary, then Transmission Provider must: (1)
specify which additional Network Upgrade costs are based on which studies; and (2)
provide a detailed explanation of why the additional Network Upgrades are necessary.
Any Interconnection Facility and/or Network Upgrade costs required for safety and
reliability also would be borne by [the]Interconnection Customer. Interconnection
Customers may be subject to additional control technologies as well as testing and
validation of those technologies consistent with Article 6 of the LGIA. The necessary
control technologies and protection systems shall be established in Appendix C of that
executed, or requested to be filed unexecuted, LGIA.
Transmission Provider shall have a process in place to study Generating Facilities that
include at least one electric storage resource using operating assumptions (i.e., whether
the interconnecting Generating Facility will or will not charge at peak load) that reflect
the proposed charging behavior of the Generating Facility as requested by
Interconnection Customer, unless Transmission Provider determines that Good Utility
Practice, including Applicable Reliability Standards, otherwise requires the use of
different operating assumptions. If Transmission Provider finds Interconnection
Customer’s requested operating assumptions conflict with Good Utility Practice,
Transmission Provider must provide Interconnection Customer an explanation in writing
of why the submitted operating assumptions are insufficient or inappropriate by no later
than thirty (30) Calendar Days before the end of the Customer Engagement Window and
allow Interconnection Customer to revise and resubmit requested operating assumptions
one time at least ten (10) Calendar Days prior to the end of the Customer Engagement
Window. Transmission Provider shall study these requests for Interconnection Service,
with the study costs borne by Interconnection Customer, using the submitted operating
assumptions for purposes of Interconnection Facilities, Network Upgrades, and
associated costs. These requests for Interconnection Service also may be subject to other
studies at the full Generating Facility Capacity to ensure safety and reliability of the
system, with the study costs borne by Interconnection Customer. Interconnection
Customer’s Generating Facility may be subject to additional control technologies as well
as testing and validation of such additional control technologies consistent with Article 6
of the LGIA. The necessary control technologies and protection systems shall be set forth
in Appendix C of the Interconnection Customer’s LGIA.
3.2

Identification of Types of Interconnection Services.

At the time the Interconnection Request is submitted, Interconnection Customer must
request either Energy Resource Interconnection Service or Network Resource
Interconnection Service, as described; provided, however, any Interconnection Customer
requesting Network Resource Interconnection Service may also request that it be
concurrently studied for Energy Resource Interconnection Service, up to the point when
an Interconnection Facilit[y]ies Study Agreement is executed. Interconnection Customer
may then elect to proceed with Network Resource Interconnection Service or to proceed

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 18 -

under a lower level of interconnection service to the extent that only certain upgrades will
be completed.
3.2.1 Energy Resource Interconnection Service.
3.2.1.1 The Product.
Energy Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection Customer to connect
the Large Generating Facility to the Transmission System and be eligible to deliver the
Large Generating Facility's output using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the
Transmission System on an "as available" basis. Energy Resource Interconnection
Service does not in and of itself convey any right to deliver electricity to any specific
customer or Point of Delivery.
3.2.1.2 The Study.
The study consists of short circuit/fault duty, steady state (thermal and voltage) and
stability analyses. The short circuit/fault duty analysis would identify direct
Interconnection Facilities required and the Network Upgrades necessary to address short
circuit issues associated with the Interconnection Facilities. The stability and steady state
studies would identify necessary upgrades to allow full output of the proposed Large
Generating Facility, except for Generating Facilities that include at least one electric
storage resource that request to use operating assumptions pursuant to Section 3.1.2,
unless the Transmission Provider determines that Good Utility Practice, including
Applicable Reliability Standards, otherwise requires the use of different operating
assumptions, and would also identify the maximum allowed output, at the time the study
is performed, of the interconnecting Large Generating Facility without requiring
additional Network Upgrades.
3.2.2 Network Resource Interconnection Service.
3.2.2.1 The Product.
Transmission Provider must conduct the necessary studies and construct the Network
Upgrades needed to integrate the Large Generating Facility (1) in a manner comparable
to that in which Transmission Provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native
load customers; or (2) in an ISO or RTO with market based congestion management, in
the same manner as Network Resources. Network Resource Interconnection Service
Allows Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility to be designated as a
Network Resource, up to the Large Generating Facility's full output, on the same basis as
existing Network Resources interconnected to Transmission Provider's Transmission
System, and to be studied as a Network Resource on the assumption that such a
designation will occur.

3.2.2.2 The Study.
The Interconnection Study for Network Resource Interconnection Service shall assure
that Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility meets the requirements for
Network Resource Interconnection Service and as a general matter, that such Large
Generating Facility's interconnection is also studied with Transmission Provider's
Transmission System at peak load, under a variety of severely stressed conditions, to
determine whether, with the Large Generating Facility at full output, except for
Generating Facilities that include at least one electric storage resource that request to
use, and for which Transmission Provider approves, operating assumptions pursuant to
Section 3.1.2, the aggregate of generation in the local area can be delivered to the
aggregate of load on Transmission Provider's Transmission System, consistent with
Transmission Provider's reliability criteria and procedures. This approach assumes that
some portion of existing Network Resources are displaced by the output of
Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility. Network Resource
Interconnection Service in and of itself does not convey any right to deliver electricity to
any specific customer or Point of Delivery. The Transmission Provider may also study
the Transmission System under non-peak load conditions. However, upon request by the
Interconnection Customer, the Transmission Provider must explain in writing to the
Interconnection Customer why the study of non-peak load conditions is required for
reliability purposes.
3.3

Utilization of Surplus Interconnection Service.

Transmission Provider must provide a process that allows an Interconnection Customer
to utilize or transfer Surplus Interconnection Service at an existing Point of
Interconnection. The original Interconnection Customer or one of its affiliates shall have
priority to utilize Surplus Interconnection Service. If the existing Interconnection
Customer or one of its affiliates does not exercise its priority, then that service may be
made available to other potential Interconnection Customers.
3.3.1 Surplus Interconnection Service Request.
Surplus Interconnection Service requests may be made by the existing Interconnection
Customer [whose Generating Facility is already interconnected]or one of its affiliates or
may be submitted once Interconnection Customer has executed the LGIA or requested
that the LGIA be filed unexecuted. Surplus Interconnection Service requests also may be
made by another Interconnection Customer. Transmission Provider shall provide a
process for evaluating Interconnection Requests for Surplus Interconnection Service.
Studies for Surplus Interconnection Service shall consist of reactive power, short
circuit/fault duty, stability analyses, and any other appropriate studies. Steady-state
(thermal/voltage) analyses may be performed as necessary to ensure that all required

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 20 -

reliability conditions are studied. If the Surplus Interconnection Service was not studied
under off-peak conditions, off-peak steady state analyses shall be performed to the
required level necessary to demonstrate reliable operation of the Surplus Interconnection
Service. If the original system impact study report or Cluster Study Report is not
available for the Surplus Interconnection Service, both off-peak and peak analysis may
need to be performed for the existing Generating Facility associated with the request for
Surplus Interconnection Service. The reactive power, short circuit/fault duty, stability,
and steady-state analyses for Surplus Interconnection Service will identify any additional
Interconnection Facilities and/or Network Upgrades necessary.
Transmission Provider shall study Surplus Interconnection Service requests for a
Generating Facility that includes at least one electric storage resource using operating
assumptions (i.e., whether the interconnecting Generating Facility will or will not charge
at peak load) that reflect the proposed charging behavior of the Generating Facility as
requested by Interconnection Customer, unless Transmission Provider determines that
Good Utility Practice, including Applicable Reliability Standards, otherwise requires the
use of different operating assumptions.
3.4

Valid Interconnection Request.

3.4.1 Cluster Request Window.
Transmission Provider shall accept Interconnection Requests during a forty-five (45)
Calendar Day period (the Cluster Request Window). The initial Cluster Request Window
shall open for Interconnection Requests beginning {Transmission Provider to provide
number of Calendar Days} after the conclusion of the transition process set out in
Section 5.1 of this LGIP and successive Cluster Request Windows shall open annually
every {Transmission Provider to provide Month and Day (e.g., January 1)} thereafter.
3.4.[1]2 Initiating an Interconnection Request.
An Interconnection Customer seeking to join a Cluster shall submit its Interconnection
Request to Transmission Provider within, and no later than the close of, the Cluster
Request Window. Interconnection Requests submitted outside of the Cluster Request
Window will not be considered. To initiate an Interconnection Request, Interconnection
Customer must submit all of the following:

(iii) demonstration of no less than ninety percent (90%) Site Control or [a posting
of an additional deposit of $10,000. Such deposits shall be applied toward any
Interconnection Studies, pursuant to the Interconnection Request. If
Interconnection Customer demonstrates Site Control within the cure period
specified in Section 3.4.3 after submitting its Interconnection Request, the
additional deposit shall be refundable; otherwise, all such deposit(s), additional
and initial, become non-refundable.] (1) a signed affidavit from an officer of the
company indicating that Site Control is unobtainable due to regulatory limitations
as such term is defined by the Transmission Provider; and (2) documentation
sufficiently describing and explaining the source and effects of such regulatory
limitations, including a description of any conditions that must be met to satisfy
the regulatory limitations and the anticipated time by which Interconnection
Customer expects to satisfy the regulatory requirements and (3) a deposit in lieu
of Site Control of $10,000 per MW, subject to a minimum of $500,000 and a
maximum of $2,000,000. Interconnection Requests from multiple Interconnection
Customers for multiple Generating Facilities that share a site must include a
contract or other agreement that allows for shared land use.
(iv) Generating Facility Capacity (MW) (and requested Interconnection Service
level if the requested Interconnection Service is less than the Generating Facility
Capacity),
(v) If applicable, (1) the requested operating assumptions (i.e., whether the
interconnecting Generating Facility will or will not charge at peak load) to be
used by Transmission Provider that reflect the proposed charging behavior of the
Generating Facility that includes at least one electric storage resource, and (2) a
description of any control technologies (software and/or hardware) that will limit
the operation of the Generating Facility to the operating assumptions submitted by
Interconnection Customer.
(vi) A Commercial Readiness Deposit equal to two times the study deposit
described in Section 3.1.1.1 of this LGIP in the form of an irrevocable letter of
credit or cash. This Commercial Readiness Deposit is refunded to Interconnection
Customer according to Section 3.7 of this LGIP,
(vii) A Point of Interconnection, and
(viii) Whether the Interconnection Request shall be studied for Network Resource
Interconnection Service or for Energy Resource Interconnection Service,
consistent with Section 3.2 of this LGIP.
An Interconnection Customer that submits a deposit in lieu of Site Control due to
demonstrated regulatory limitations must demonstrate that it is taking identifiable steps

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the applicable federal, state, and/or
tribal entities before execution of the Cluster Study Agreement. Such deposit will be held
by Transmission Provider until Interconnection Customer provides the required Site
Control demonstration for its point in the Cluster Study Process. Interconnection
Customers facing qualifying regulatory limitations must demonstrate one-hundred
percent (100%) Site Control within one-hundred eighty (180) Calendar Days of the
effective date of the LGIA.
Interconnection Customer shall promptly inform Transmission Provider of any material
change to Interconnection Customer’s demonstration of Site Control under Section
3.4.2(iii) of this LGIP. If Transmission Provider determines, based on Interconnection
Customer’s information, that Interconnection Customer no longer satisfies the Site
Control requirement, Transmission Provider shall give Interconnection Customer ten
(10) Business Days to demonstrate satisfaction with the applicable requirement subject to
Transmission Provider’s approval. Absent such, Transmission Provider shall deem the
Interconnection Request withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.7 of this LGIP.
The expected In-Service Date of the new Large Generating Facility or increase in
capacity of the existing Generating Facility shall be no more than the process window for
the regional expansion planning period (or in the absence of a regional planning process,
the process window for Transmission Provider's expansion planning period) not to
exceed seven years from the date the Interconnection Request is received by
Transmission Provider, unless Interconnection Customer demonstrates that engineering,
permitting and construction of the new Large Generating Facility or increase in capacity
of the existing Generating Facility will take longer than the regional expansion planning
period. The In-Service Date may succeed the date the Interconnection Request is received
by Transmission Provider by a period up to ten years, or longer where Interconnection
Customer and Transmission Provider agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld.
3.4.[2]3 Acknowledgment of Interconnection Request.
Transmission Provider shall acknowledge receipt of the Interconnection Request within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of the request and attach a copy of the received
Interconnection Request to the acknowledgement.
3.4.[3]4 Deficiencies in Interconnection Request.
An Interconnection Request will not be considered to be a valid request until all items in
Section [3.4.1]3.4.2 of this LGIP have been received by Transmission Provider. If an
Interconnection Request fails to meet the requirements set forth in Section [3.4.1]3.4.2 of
this LGIP, Transmission Provider shall notify Interconnection Customer within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of the initial Interconnection Request of the reasons for such

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

failure and that the Interconnection Request does not constitute a valid request.
Interconnection Customer shall provide Transmission Provider the additional requested
information needed to constitute a valid request within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such notice but no later than the close of the Cluster Request Window. At any
time, if Transmission Provider finds that the technical data provided by Interconnection
Customer is incomplete or contains errors, Interconnection Customer and Transmission
Provider shall work expeditiously and in good faith to remedy such issues. In the event
that [Failure by] Interconnection Customer fails to comply with this Section 3.4.[3]4 of
this LGIP, Transmission Providers shall deem the Interconnection Request withdrawn
(without the cure period provided under Section 3.7 of this LGIP), the application fee is
forfeited to the Transmission Provider, and the study deposit and Commercial Readiness
Deposit shall be returned to Interconnection Customer [shall be treated in accordance
with Section 3.7].
3.4.5 Customer Engagement Window.
Upon the close of each Cluster Request Window, Transmission Provider shall open a
sixty (60) Calendar Day period (Customer Engagement Window). During the Customer
Engagement Window, Transmission Provider shall hold a Scoping Meeting with all
interested Interconnection Customers. Notwithstanding the preceding requirements and
upon written consent of all Interconnection Customers within the Cluster, Transmission
Provider may shorten the Customer Engagement Window and begin the Cluster Study.
Within ten (10) Business Days of the opening of the Customer Engagement Window,
Transmission Provider shall post on its OASIS a list of Interconnection Requests for that
Cluster. The list shall identify, for each anonymized Interconnection Request: (1) the
requested amount of Interconnection Service; (2) the location by county and state; (3) the
station or transmission line or lines where the interconnection will be made; (4) the
projected In-Service Date; (5) the type of Interconnection Service requested; and (6) the
type of Generating Facility or Facilities to be constructed, including fuel types, such as
coal, natural gas, solar, or wind. The Transmission Provider must ensure that project
information is anonymized and does not reveal the identity or commercial information of
interconnection customers with submitted requests. During the Customer Engagement
Window, Transmission Provider shall provide to Interconnection Customer a nonbinding updated good faith estimate of the cost and timeframe for completing the Cluster
Study and a Cluster Study Agreement to be executed prior to the close of the Customer
Engagement Window.
At the end of the Customer Engagement Window, all Interconnection Requests deemed
valid that have executed a Cluster Study Agreement in the form of Appendix 2 to this
LGIP shall be included in the Cluster Study. Any Interconnection Requests not deemed
valid at the close of the Customer Engagement Window shall be deemed withdrawn

calendar quarter.
3.6

Coordination with Affected Systems.

Transmission Provider will coordinate the conduct of any studies required to determine
the impact of the Interconnection Request on Affected Systems with Affected System
Operators[and, if possible, include those results in its applicable Interconnection Study
within the time frame specified in this LGIP. Transmission Provider will include such
Affected System Operators in all meetings held with Interconnection Customer as
required by this LGIP]. Interconnection Customer will cooperate with Transmission
Provider and Affected System Operator in all matters related to the conduct of studies and
the determination of modifications to Affected Systems.
A Transmission Provider whose system may be impacted by a proposed interconnection
on another transmission provider’s transmission system [which may be an Affected
System] shall cooperate with the [T]transmission [P]provider with whom interconnection

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 30 -

has been requested in all matters related to the conduct of studies and the determination
of modifications to Transmission Provider’s Transmission System[Affected Systems].
3.6.1 Initial Notification.
Transmission Provider must notify Affected System Operator of a potential Affected
System impact caused by an Interconnection Request within ten (10) Business Days of the
completion of the Cluster Study or, if the potential Affected System impact is only
determined in the Cluster Restudy, the completion of the Cluster Restudy.
At the time of initial notification, Transmission Provider must provide Interconnection
Customer with a list of potential Affected Systems, along with relevant contact
information.
3.7 Withdrawal.
Interconnection Customer may withdraw its Interconnection Request at any time by
written notice of such withdrawal to Transmission Provider. In addition, if
Interconnection Customer fails to adhere to all requirements of this LGIP, except as
provided in Section 13.5 (Disputes), Transmission Provider shall deem the
Interconnection Request to be withdrawn and shall provide written notice to
Interconnection Customer of the deemed withdrawal and an explanation of the reasons
for such deemed withdrawal. Upon receipt of such written notice, Interconnection
Customer shall have fifteen (15) Business Days in which to either respond with
information or actions that cures the deficiency or to notify Transmission Provider of its
intent to pursue Dispute Resolution.
Withdrawal shall result in the loss of Interconnection Customer’s Queue Position. If an
Interconnection Customer disputes the withdrawal and loss of its Queue Position, then
during Dispute Resolution, Interconnection Customer’s Interconnection Request is
eliminated from the queue until such time that the outcome of Dispute Resolution would
restore its Queue Position. An Interconnection Customer that withdraws or is deemed to
have withdrawn its Interconnection Request shall pay to Transmission Provider all costs
that Transmission Provider prudently incurs with respect to that Interconnection Request
prior to Transmission Provider’s receipt of notice described above. Interconnection
Customer must pay all monies due to Transmission Provider before it is allowed to obtain
any Interconnection Study data or results.
If Interconnection Customer withdraws its Interconnection Request or is deemed
withdrawn by Transmission Provider under Section 3.7 of this LGIP, Transmission
Provider shall (i) update the OASIS Queue Position posting; (ii) impose the Withdrawal
Penalty described in Section 3.7.1 of this LGIP; and (iii) refund to Interconnection
Customer any portion of the refundable portion of Interconnection Customer’s study

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

- 31 -

deposit [or study payments] that exceeds the costs that Transmission Provider has
incurred, including interest calculated in accordance with Section 35.19a(a)(2) of FERC's
regulations. Transmission Provider shall also refund any portion of the Commercial
Readiness Deposit not applied to the Withdrawal Penalty and, if applicable, the deposit
in lieu of site control. In the event of such withdrawal, Transmission Provider, subject to
the confidentiality provisions of Section 13.1 of this LGIP, shall provide, at
Interconnection Customer's request, all information that Transmission Provider
developed for any completed study conducted up to the date of withdrawal of the
Interconnection Request.
3.7.1

Withdrawal Penalty.

Interconnection Customer shall be subject to a Withdrawal Penalty if it withdraws its
Interconnection Request or is deemed withdrawn, or the Generating Facility does not
otherwise reach Commercial Operation unless: (1) the withdrawal does not have a
material impact on the cost or timing of any Interconnection Request with an equal or
lower Queue Position; (2) Interconnection Customer withdraws after receiving
Interconnection Customer’s most recent Cluster Restudy Report and the Network
Upgrade costs assigned to the Interconnection Request identified in that report have
increased by more than twenty-five percent (25%) compared to costs identified in
Interconnection Customer’s preceding Cluster Study Report or Cluster Restudy Report;
or (3) Interconnection Customer withdraws after receiving Interconnection Customer’s
Interconnection Facilities Study Report and the Network Upgrade costs assigned to the
Interconnection Request identified in that report have increased by more than one
hundred percent (100%) compared to costs identified in the Cluster Study Report.
3.7.1.1 Calculation of the Withdrawal Penalty.
If Interconnection Customer withdraws its Interconnection Request or is deemed
withdrawn prior to the commencement of the initial Cluster Study, Interconnection
Customer shall not be subject to a Withdrawal Penalty. If Interconnection Customer
withdraws, is deemed withdrawn, or otherwise does not reach Commercial Operation at
any point after the commencement of the initial Cluster Study, that Interconnection
Customer’s Withdrawal Penalty will be the greater of: (1) the Interconnection
Customer’s study deposit required under Section 3.1.1.1 of this LGIP; or (2) as follows in
(a) –(d):
(a)
If Interconnection Customer withdraws or is deemed withdrawn during the
Cluster Study or after receipt of a Cluster Study Report, but prior to
commencement of the Cluster Restudy or Interconnection Facilities Study,
Interconnection Customer shall be charged two (2) times its actual allocated cost
of all studies performed for Interconnection Customers in the Cluster up until that
point in the interconnection study process.

- 32 -

(b)
If Interconnection Customer withdraws or is deemed withdrawn during the
Cluster Restudy or after receipt of any applicable restudy reports issued pursuant
to Section 7.5 of this LGIP, but prior to commencement of the Interconnection
Facilities Study, Interconnection Customer shall be charged five percent (5%) its
estimated Network Upgrade costs.
(c)
If Interconnection Customer withdraws or is deemed withdrawn during the
Interconnection Facilities Study, after receipt of the Interconnection Facilities
Study Report issued pursuant to Section 8.3 of this LGIP, or after receipt of the
draft LGIA but before Interconnection Customer has executed an LGIA or has
requested that its LGIA be filed unexecuted, and has satisfied the other
requirements described in Section 11.3 of this LGIP (i.e., Site Control
demonstration, LGIA Deposit, reasonable evidence of one or more milestones in
the development of the Generating Facility), Interconnection Customer shall be
charged ten percent (10%) its estimated Network Upgrade costs.
(d)
If Interconnection Customer has executed an LGIA or has requested that its
LGIA be filed unexecuted and has satisfied the other requirements described in
Section 11.3 of this LGIP (i.e., Site Control demonstration, LGIA Deposit,
reasonable evidence of one or more milestones in the development of the
Generating Facility) and subsequently withdraws its Interconnection Request or if
Interconnection Customer’s Generating Facility otherwise does not reach
Commercial Operation, that Interconnection Customer’s Withdrawal Penalty
shall be twenty percent (20%) its estimated Network Upgrade costs.
3.7.1.2 Distribution of the Withdrawal Penalty.
3.7.1.2.1 Initial Distribution of Withdrawal Penalties Prior to Assessment of Network
Upgrade Costs Previously Shared with Withdrawn Interconnection Customers in the
Same Cluster
For a single cluster, Transmission Provider shall hold all Withdrawal Penalty funds until
all Interconnection Customers in that Cluster have either: (1) withdrawn or been deemed
withdrawn; (2) executed an LGIA; or (3) requested an LGIA to be filed unexecuted. Any
Withdrawal Penalty funds collected from the Cluster shall first be used to fund studies
conducted under the Cluster Study Process for Interconnection Customers in the same
Cluster that have executed the LGIA or requested the LGIA to be filed unexecuted. Next,
after the Withdrawal Penalty funds are applied to relevant study costs in the same
Cluster, Transmission Provider will apply the remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds to
reduce net increases, for Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster, in
Interconnection Customers’ Network Upgrade cost assignment and associated financial
security requirements under Article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA attributable to the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 33 -

impacts of withdrawn Interconnection Customers that shared an obligation with the
remaining Interconnection Customers to fund a Network Upgrade, as described in more
detail in Sections 3.7.1.2.3 and 3.7.1.2.4.
Withdrawal Penalty funds shall first be applied as a refund to invoiced study costs for
Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster that did not withdraw within 30 Calendar
Days of such Interconnection Customers executing their LGIA or requesting to have their
LGIA filed unexecuted. Distribution of Withdrawal Penalty funds within one specific
Cluster Study for study costs shall not exceed the total actual Cluster Study costs.
Withdrawal Penalty funds applied to study costs shall be allocated within the same
Cluster to Interconnection Customers in a manner consistent with the Transmission
Provider’s method in Section 13.3 of this LGIP for allocating the costs of interconnection
studies conducted on a clustered basis. Transmission Provider shall post the balance of
Withdrawal Penalty funds held by Transmission Provider but not yet dispersed on its
OASIS site and update this posting on a quarterly basis.
If an Interconnection Customer withdraws after it executes, or requests the unexecuted
filing of, its LGIA, Transmission Provider shall first apply such Interconnection
Customer’s Withdrawal Penalty funds to any restudy costs required due to the
Interconnection Customer’s withdrawal as a credit to as-yet-to be invoiced study costs to
be charged to the remaining Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster in a manner
consistent with the Transmission Provider’s method in Section 13.3 of this LGIP for
allocating the costs of interconnection studies conducted on a clustered basis.
Distribution of the Withdrawal Penalty funds for such restudy costs shall not exceed the
total actual restudy costs.
3.7.1.2.2 Assessment of Network Upgrade Costs Previously Shared with Withdrawn
Interconnection Customers in the Same Cluster
If Withdrawal Penalty funds remain for the same Cluster after the Withdrawal Penalty
funds are applied to relevant study costs, Transmission Provider will determine if the
withdrawn Interconnection Customers, at any point in the Cluster Study Process, shared
cost assignment for one or more Network Upgrades with any remaining Interconnection
Customers in the same Cluster based on the Cluster Study Report, Cluster Restudy
Report(s), Interconnection Facilities Study Report, and any subsequent issued restudy
report issued for the Cluster.
In section 3.7.1.2 of this LGIP, shared cost assignments for Network Upgrades refers to
the cost of Network Upgrades still needed for the same Cluster for which an
Interconnection Customer, prior to withdrawing its Interconnection Request, shared the
obligation to fund along with Interconnection Customers that have executed an LGIA, or
requested the LGIA to filed unexecuted.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 34 -

If Transmission Provider’s assessment determines that there are no shared cost
assignments for any Network Upgrades in the same Cluster for the withdrawn
Interconnection Customer, or determines that the withdrawn Interconnection Customer’s
withdrawal did not cause a net increase in the shared cost assignment for any remaining
Interconnection Customers’ Network Upgrade(s) in the same Cluster, Transmission
Provider will return any remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds to the withdrawn
Interconnection Customer(s). Such remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds will be returned
to withdrawn Interconnection Customers based on the proportion of each withdrawn
Interconnection Customer’s contribution to the total amount of Withdrawal Penalty funds
collected for the Cluster (i.e., the total amount before the initial disbursement required
under Section 3.7.1.2.1 of this LGIP). Transmission Provider must make such
disbursement within sixty (60) Calendar Days of the date on which all Interconnection
Customers in the same Cluster have either: (1) withdrawn or been deemed withdrawn;
(2) executed an LGIA; or (3) requested an LGIA to be filed unexecuted. For the
withdrawn Interconnection Customers that Transmission Provider determines have
caused a net increase in the shared cost assignment for one or more Network Upgrade(s)
in the same Cluster under subsection 3.7.1.2.3(a), Transmission Provider will determine
each such withdrawn Interconnection Customers’ Withdrawal Penalty funds remaining
balance that will be applied toward net increases in Network Upgrade shared costs
calculated under subsections 3.7.1.2.3(a) and 3.7.1.2.3(b) based on each such withdrawn
Interconnection Customer’s proportional contribution to the total amount of Withdrawal
Penalty funds collected for the same Cluster (i.e., the total amount before the initial
disbursement requirement under Section 3.7.1.2.1 of this LGIP).
If the Transmission Provider’s assessment determines that there are shared cost
assignments for Network Upgrades in the same Cluster, Transmission Provider will
calculate the remaining Interconnection Customers’ net increase in cost assignment for
Network Upgrades due to a shared cost assignment for Network Upgrades with the
withdrawn Interconnection Customer and distribute Withdrawal Penalty funds as
described in Section 3.7.1.2.3, depending on whether the withdrawal occurred before the
withdrawing Interconnection Customer executed the LGIA (or filed unexecuted), as
described in subsection 3.7.1.2.3(a), or after such execution (or filing unexecuted) of an
LGIA, as described in subsection 3.7.1.2.3(b).
As discussed in subsection 3.7.1.2.4, Transmission Provider will amend executed (or filed
unexecuted) LGIAs of the remaining Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster to
apply the remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds to reduce net increases in Interconnection
Customers’ Network Upgrade cost assignment and associated financial security
requirements under Article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA attributable to the impacts of
withdrawn Interconnection Customers on Interconnection Customers remaining in the
same Cluster that had a shared cost assignment for Network Upgrades with the
withdrawn Interconnection Customers.

3.7.1.2.3 Impact Calculations
3.7.1.2.3(a) Impact Calculation for Withdrawals During the Cluster Study Process
If an Interconnection Customer withdraws before it executes, or requests the unexecuted
filing of, its LGIA, the Transmission Provider will distribute in the following manner the
Withdrawal Penalty funds to reduce the Network Upgrade cost impact on the remaining
Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster who had a shared cost assignment for a
Network Upgrade with the withdrawn Interconnection Customer.
To calculate the reduction in the remaining Interconnection Customers’ net increase in
Network Upgrade costs and associated financial security requirements under Article 11.5
of the pro forma LGIA, the Transmission Provider will determine the financial impact of
a withdrawing Interconnection Customer on other Interconnection Customers in the
same Cluster that shared an obligation to fund the same Network Upgrade(s).
Transmission Provider shall calculate this financial impact once all the Interconnection
Customers in the same Cluster either: (1) have withdrawn or have been deemed
withdrawn; (2) executed an LGIA; or (3) request an LGIA to be filed unexecuted.
Transmission Provider will perform the financial impact calculation using the following
steps.
First, Transmission Provider must determine which withdrawn Interconnection
Customers shared an obligation to fund Network Upgrades with Interconnection
Customers from the same Cluster that have LGIAs that are executed or have been
requested to be filed unexecuted. Next, Transmission Provider shall perform the
calculation of the financial impact of a withdrawal on another Interconnection Request in
the same Cluster by performing a comparison of the Network Upgrade cost estimates
between each of the following:
(1) Cluster Study phase to Cluster Restudy phase (if Cluster Restudy was
necessary);
(2) Cluster Restudy phase to Facilities Study phase (if a Cluster Restudy was
necessary);
(3) Cluster Study phase to Facilities Study phase (if no Cluster Restudy was
performed);
(4) Facilities Study phase to any subsequent restudy that was performed before the
execution or filing of an unexecuted LGIA;

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 36 -

(5) the restudy to the executed, or filed unexecuted, LGIA (if a restudy was
performed after the Facilities Study phase and before the execution or filing of an
unexecuted LGIA).
If, based on the above calculations, Transmission Provider determines:
(i) that the costs assigned to an Interconnection Customer in the same Cluster for
Network Upgrades that a withdrawn Interconnection Customer shared cost
assignment for increased between any two studies, and
(ii) after the impacted Interconnection Customer’s LGIA was executed or filed
unexecuted, the Interconnection Customer’s cost assignment for the relevant
Network Upgrade is greater than it was prior to the withdrawal of the
Interconnection Customer in the same Cluster that shared cost assignment for the
Network Upgrade,
then Transmission Provider shall apply the withdrawn Interconnection Customer’s
Withdrawal Penalty funds that has not already been applied to study costs in the amount
of the financial impact by reducing, in the same Cluster, the remaining Interconnection
Customer’s Network Upgrade costs and associated financial security requirements under
Article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA.
If Transmission Provider determines that more than one Interconnection Customer in the
same Cluster was financially impacted by the same withdrawn Interconnection Customer,
Transmission Provider will apply the relevant withdrawn Interconnection Customer’s
Withdrawal Penalty funds that has not already been applied to study costs to reduce the
financial impact to each Interconnection Customer based on each Interconnection
Customer’s proportional share of the financial impact, as determined by either the
proportional impact method if it is a System Network Upgrade or on a per capita basis if
it is a Substation Network Upgrade, as described under Section 4.2.1 of this LGIP.
3.7.1.2.3(b) Impact Calculation for Withdrawals in the Same Cluster After the Cluster
Study Process
If an Interconnection Customer withdraws after it executes, or requests the unexecuted
filing of, its LGIA, Transmission Provider will distribute in the following manner the
remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds to reduce the Network Upgrade cost impact on the
remaining Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster who had a shared cost
assignment with the withdrawn Interconnection Customer for one or more Network
Upgrades.
Transmission Provider will determine the financial impact on the remaining
Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster within 30 calendar days after the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 37 -

withdrawal occurs. The Transmission Provider will determine that financial impact by
comparing the Network Upgrade cost funding obligations the Interconnection Customers
shared with the withdrawn Interconnection Customer before the withdrawal of the
Interconnection Customer and after the withdrawal of the Interconnection Customer. If
that comparison indicates an increase in Network Upgrade costs for an Interconnection
Customer, Transmission Provider shall apply the withdrawn Interconnection Customer’s
Withdrawal Penalty funds to the increased costs each impacted Interconnection
Customer in the same Cluster experienced associated with such Network Upgrade(s) in
proportion to each Interconnection Customer’s increased cost assignment, as determined
by Transmission Provider.
3.7.1.2.4 Amending LGIA to Apply Reductions to Interconnection Customer’s
Assigned Network Upgrade Costs and Associated Financial Security Requirement with
Respect to Withdrawals in the Same Cluster
Within 30 Calendar Days of all Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster having:
(1) withdrawn or been deemed withdrawn; (2) executed an LGIA; or (3) requested an
LGIA to be filed unexecuted, Transmission Provider must perform the calculations
described in subsection 3.7.1.2.3(a) of this LGIP and provide such Interconnection
Customers with an amended LGIA that provides the reduction in Network Upgrade cost
assignment and associated reduction to the Interconnection Customer’s financial security
requirements, under Article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA, due from the Interconnection
Customer to the Transmission Provider.
Where an Interconnection Customer executes the LGIA (or requests the filing of an
unexecuted LGIA) and is later withdrawn or its LGIA is terminated, Transmission
Provider must, within 30 Calendar Days of such withdrawal or termination, perform the
calculations described in subsection 3.7.1.2.3(b) of this LGIP and provide such
Interconnection Customers in the same Cluster with an amended LGIA that provides the
reduction in Network Upgrade cost assignment and associated reduction to the
Interconnection Customer’s financial security requirements, under Article 11.5 of the pro
forma LGIA, due from the Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider.
Any repayment by Transmission Provider to Interconnection Customer under Article 11.4
of the pro forma LGIA of amounts advanced for Network Upgrades after the Generating
Facility achieves Commercial Operation shall be limited to the Interconnection
Customer’s total amount of Network Upgrade costs paid and associated financial
security provided to Transmission Provider under Article 11.5 of the pro forma LGIA.
3.7.1.2.5 Final Distribution of Withdrawal Penalty Funds
If Withdrawal Penalty funds remain for the Cluster after the Withdrawal Penalty funds
are applied to relevant study costs and net increases in shared cost assignments for

return any remaining Withdrawal Penalty funds to the withdrawn Interconnection
Customers in the same Cluster net of the amount of each withdrawn Interconnection
Customer’s Withdrawal Penalty funds applied to study costs and net increases in shared
cost assignments for Network Upgrades to remaining Interconnection Customers.
3.8 Identification of Contingent Facilities.
Transmission Provider shall post in this section a method for identifying the Contingent
Facilities to be provided to Interconnection Customer at the conclusion of the [System
Impact]Cluster Study and included in Interconnection Customer’s Large Generator
Interconnection Agreement. The method shall be sufficiently transparent to determine
why a specific Contingent Facility was identified and how it relates to the
Interconnection Request. Transmission Provider shall also provide, upon request of
[the]Interconnection Customer, the estimated Interconnection Facility and/or Network
Upgrade costs and estimated in-service completion time of each identified Contingent
Facility when this information is readily available and not commercially sensitive.
3.9 Penalties for Failure to Meet Study Deadlines.
(1) Transmission Provider shall be subject to a penalty if it fails to complete a Cluster
Study, Cluster Restudy, Interconnection Facilities Study, or Affected Systems Study by the
applicable deadline set forth in this LGIP. Transmission Provider must pay the penalty
for each late Cluster Study, Cluster Restudy, and Interconnection Facilities Study on a
pro rata basis per Interconnection Request to all Interconnection Customer(s) included
in the relevant study that did not withdraw, or were not deemed withdrawn, from
Transmission Provider’s interconnection queue before the missed study deadline.
Transmission Provider must pay the penalty for a late Affected Systems Study on a pro
rata basis per interconnection request to all Affected System Interconnection Customer(s)
included in the relevant Affected System Study that did not withdraw, or were not deemed
withdrawn, from the host transmission provider’s interconnection queue before the
missed study deadline. The study delay penalty for each late study shall be distributed no
later than forty-five (45) Calendar Days after the late study has been completed.
(2) For penalties assessed in accordance with this Section, the penalty amount will be
equal to: $1,000 per Business Day for delays of Cluster Studies beyond the applicable
deadline set forth in this LGIP; $2,000 per Business Day for delays of Cluster Re-Studies
beyond the applicable deadline set forth in this LGIP; $2,000 per Business Day for
delays of Affected System Studies beyond the applicable deadline set forth in this LGIP;
and $2,500 per Business Day for delays of Interconnection Facilities Studies beyond the
applicable deadline set forth in this LGIP. The total amount of a penalty assessed under
this Section shall not exceed: (a) one hundred percent (100%) of the initial study
deposit(s) received for all of the Interconnection Requests in the Cluster for Cluster

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Studies and Cluster Restudies; (b) one hundred percent (100%) of the initial study
deposit received for the single Interconnection Request in the study for Facilities Studies;
and (c) one hundred percent (100%) of the study deposit(s) that Transmission Provider
collects for conducting the Affected System Study.
(3) Transmission Provider may appeal to the Commission any penalties imposed under
this Section. Any such appeal must be filed no later than forty-five (45) Calendar Days
after the late study has been completed. While an appeal to the Commission is pending,
Transmission Provider shall remain liable for the penalty, but need not distribute the
penalty until forty-five (45) Calendar Days after (1) the deadline for filing a rehearing
request has ended, if no requests for rehearing of the appeal have been filed, or (2) the
date that any requests for rehearing of the Commission’s decision on the appeal are no
longer pending before the Commission. The Commission may excuse Transmission
Provider from penalties under this Section for good cause.
(4) No penalty will be assessed under this Section where a study is delayed by ten (10)
Business Days or less. If the study is delayed by more than ten (10) Business Days, the
penalty amount will be calculated from the first Business Day the Transmission Provider
misses the applicable study deadline.
(5) If (a) Transmission Provider needs to extend the deadline for a particular study
subject to penalties under this Section and (b) all Interconnection Customers or Affected
System Interconnection Customers included in the relevant study mutually agree to such
an extension, the deadline for that study shall be extended thirty (30) Business Days from
the original deadline. In such a scenario, no penalty will be assessed for Transmission
Provider missing the original deadline.
(6) No penalties shall be assessed until the third Cluster Study cycle (including any
Transitional Cluster Study cycle, but not Transitional Serial Studies) after the
Commission-approved effective date of Transmission Provider’s filing made in
compliance with the Final Rule in Docket No. RM22-14-000.
(7) Transmission Provider must maintain on its OASIS or its public website summary
statistics related to penalties assessed under this Section, updated quarterly. For each
calendar quarter, Transmission Provider must calculate and post (1) the total amount of
penalties assessed under this Section during the previous reporting quarter and (2) the
highest penalty assessed under this Section paid to a single Interconnection Customer or
Affected System Interconnection Customer during the previous reporting quarter.
Transmission Provider must post on its OASIS or its website these penalty amounts for
each calendar quarter within thirty (30) Calendar Days of the end of the calendar
quarter. Transmission Provider must maintain the quarterly measures posted on its
OASIS or its website for three (3) calendar years with the first required posting to be the
third Cluster Study cycle (including any Transitional Cluster Study cycle, but not

Transitional Serial Studies) after Transmission Provider transitions to the Cluster Study
Process.
Section 4. Interconnection Request Evaluation Process. [Queue Position]
Once an Interconnection Customer has submitted a valid Interconnection Request
pursuant to Section 3.4 of this LGIP, such Interconnection Request shall become part of
the Transmission Provider’s interconnection queue for further processing pursuant to the
following procedures.
4.1 Queue Position. [General]
4.1.1 Assignment of Queue Position.
Transmission Provider shall assign a Queue Position as follows: the Queue Position
within the queue shall be assigned based upon the date and time of receipt of all items
required pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 of this LGIP. All Interconnection
Requests submitted and validated in a single Cluster Request Window shall be considered
equally queued. [based upon the date and time of receipt of the valid Interconnection
Request; provided that, if the sole reason an Interconnection Request is not valid is the
lack of required information on the application form, and Interconnection Customer
provides such information in accordance with Section 3.4.3, then Transmission Provider
shall assign Interconnection Customer a Queue Position based on the date the application
form was originally filed. Moving a Point of Interconnection shall result in a lowering of
Queue Position if it is deemed a Material Modification under Section 4.4.3.]
[The Queue Position of each Interconnection Request will be used to determine the order
of performing the Interconnection Studies and determination of cost responsibility for the
facilities necessary to accommodate the Interconnection Request. A higher queued]
4.1.2 Higher Queue Position.
A higher Queue Position assigned to an Interconnection Request is one that has been
placed “earlier” in the queue in relation to another Interconnection Request that is [lower
queued. Transmission Provider may allocate the cost of the common upgrades for
clustered Interconnection Requests without regard to Queue Position.]assigned a lower
Queue Position. All requests studied in a single Cluster shall be considered equally
queued. Interconnection Customers that are part of Clusters initiated earlier in time than
an instant Queue shall be considered to have a higher Queue Position than
Interconnection Customers that are part of Clusters initiated later than an instant Queue.

[4.2 Clustering.
At Transmission Provider’s option, Interconnection Requests may be studied serially or
in clusters for the purpose of the Interconnection System Impact Study.
Clustering shall be implemented on the basis of Queue Position. If Transmission
Provider elects to study Interconnection Requests using Clustering, all Interconnection
Requests received within a period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) Calendar
Days, hereinafter referred to as the “Queue Cluster Window” shall be studied together
without regard to the nature of the underlying Interconnection Service, whether Energy
Resource Interconnection Service or Network Resource Interconnection Service. The
deadline for completing all Interconnection System Impact Studies for which an
Interconnection System Impact Study Agreement has been executed during a Queue
Cluster Window shall be in accordance with Section 7.4, for all Interconnection Requests
assigned to the same Queue Cluster Window. Transmission Provider may study an
Interconnection Request separately to the extent warranted by Good Utility Practice
based upon the electrical remoteness of the proposed Large Generating Facility.]
4.2. General Study Process.
[Clustering Interconnection System Impact Studies]Interconnection Studies performed
within the Cluster Study Process shall be conducted in such a manner to ensure the
efficient implementation of the applicable regional transmission expansion plan in light
of the Transmission System’s capabilities at the time of each study and consistent with
Good Utility Practice.
Transmission Provider may use subgroups in the Cluster Study Process. In all instances
in which Transmission Provider elects to use subgroups in the cluster study process,
Transmission Provider must publish the criteria used to define and determine subgroups
on its OASIS or public website.
[The Queue Cluster Window shall have a fixed time interval based on fixed annual
opening and closing dates. Any changes to the established Queue Cluster Window
interval and opening or closing dates shall be announced with a posting on Transmission
Provider’s OASIS beginning at least one hundred and eighty (180) Calendar Days in
advance of the change and continuing thereafter through the end date of the first Queue
Cluster Window that is to be modified.]
4.2.1 Cost Allocation for Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades.
(1) For Network Upgrades identified in Cluster Studies, Transmission Provider shall
calculate each Interconnection Customer’s share of the costs as follows:

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 42 -

(a) Substation Network Upgrades, including all switching stations, shall be
allocated per capita to each Generating Facility interconnecting at the same
substation.
(b) System Network Upgrades shall be allocated based on the proportional impact
of each individual Generating Facility in the Cluster Study on the need for a
specific System Network Upgrade. {Transmission Provider shall include in this
section a description of how cost for each facility type designated as a network
upgrade will be allocated using its proportional impact method.}
(c) An Interconnection Customer that funds Substation Network Upgrades and/or
System Network Upgrades shall be entitled to transmission credits as provided in
Article 11.4 of the LGIA.
(2) The costs of any needed Interconnection Facilities identified in the Cluster Study
Process will be directly assigned to the Interconnection Customer(s) using such facilities.
Where Interconnection Customers in the Cluster agree to share Interconnection
Facilities, the cost of such Interconnection Facilities shall be allocated based on the
number of Generating Facilities sharing use of such Interconnection Facilities on a per
capita basis (i.e., on a per Generating Facility basis), unless Parties mutually agree to a
different cost sharing arrangement.
4.3

Transferability of Queue Position.

An Interconnection Customer may transfer its Queue Position to another entity only if
such entity acquires the specific Generating Facility identified in the Interconnection
Request and the Point of Interconnection does not change.
4.4

Modifications.

Interconnection Customer shall submit to Transmission Provider, in writing,
modifications to any information provided in the Interconnection Request.
Interconnection Customer shall retain its Queue Position if the modifications are in
accordance with Sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, or 4.4.5 of this LGIP, or are determined not to be
Material Modifications pursuant to Section 4.4.3 of this LGIP.
Notwithstanding the above, during the course of the Interconnection Studies, either
Interconnection Customer or Transmission Provider may identify changes to the planned
interconnection that may improve the costs and benefits (including reliability) of the
interconnection, and the ability of the proposed change to accommodate the
Interconnection Request. To the extent the identified changes are acceptable to
Transmission Provider[,] and Interconnection Customer, such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld, Transmission Provider shall modify the Point of Interconnection

prior to return of the executed Cluster Study Agreement, [and/or configuration in
accordance with such changes and proceed with any re-studies necessary to do so in
accordance with Section 6.4, Section 7.6 and Section 8.5 as applicable]and
Interconnection Customer shall retain its Queue Position.
4.4.1 Prior to the return of the executed [Interconnection System Impact]Cluster Study
Agreement to Transmission Provider, modifications permitted under this Section shall
include specifically: (a) a decrease of up to 60 percent of electrical output (MW) of the
proposed project, through either (1) a decrease in plant size or (2) a decrease in
Interconnection Service level (consistent with the process described in Section 3.1 of this
LGIP) accomplished by applying Transmission Provider-approved injection-limiting
equipment; (b) modifying the technical parameters associated with the Large Generating
Facility technology or the Large Generating Facility step-up transformer impedance
characteristics; and (c) modifying the interconnection configuration. For plant increases,
the incremental increase in plant output will go [to]in the [end of the queue]next Cluster
Study Window for the purposes of cost allocation and study analysis.
4.4.2 Prior to the return of the executed Interconnection Facilit[y]ies Study Agreement
to Transmission Provider, the modifications permitted under this Section shall include
specifically: (a) additional 15 percent decrease of electrical output of the proposed project
through either (1) a decrease in plant size (MW) or (2) a decrease in Interconnection
Service level (consistent with the process described in Section 3.1) accomplished by
applying Transmission Provider-approved injection-limiting equipment; (b) Large
Generating Facility technical parameters associated with modifications to Large
Generating Facility technology and transformer impedances; provided, however, the
incremental costs associated with those modifications are the responsibility of the
requesting Interconnection Customer; and (c) a Permissible Technological Advancement
for the Large Generating Facility after the submission of the Interconnection Request.
Section 4.4.6 specifies a separate technological change procedure including the requisite
information and process that will be followed to assess whether the Interconnection
Customer’s proposed technological advancement under Section 4.4.2(c) is a Material
Modification. Section 1 contains a definition of Permissible Technological
Advancement.
4.4.3 Prior to making any modification other than those specifically permitted by
Sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.5 of this LGIP, Interconnection Customer may first request
that Transmission Provider evaluate whether such modification is a Material
Modification. In response to Interconnection Customer's request, Transmission Provider
shall evaluate the proposed modifications prior to making them and inform
Interconnection Customer in writing of whether the modifications would constitute a
Material Modification. Any change to the Point of Interconnection, except those deemed
acceptable under Sections 3.1.2 or 4.4 of this LGIP[.1, 6.1, 7.2] or so allowed elsewhere,
shall constitute a Material Modification. Interconnection Customer may then withdraw

- 44 -

the proposed modification or proceed with a new Interconnection Request for such
modification. Transmission Provider shall study the addition of a Generating Facility
that includes at least one electric storage resource using operating assumptions (i.e.,
whether the interconnecting Generating Facility will or will not charge at peak load) that
reflect the proposed charging behavior of the Generating Facility as requested by
Interconnection Customer, unless Transmission Provider determines that Good Utility
Practice, including Applicable Reliability Standards, otherwise requires the use of
different operating assumptions.
{Transmission Providers using fuel-based dispatch assumptions in Interconnection
Studies are not required to include Section 4.4.3.1 because it does not apply to them}
4.4.3.1 Interconnection Customer may request, and Transmission Provider shall
evaluate, the addition to the Interconnection Request of a Generating Facility with the
same Point of Interconnection indicated in the initial Interconnection Request, if the
addition of the Generating Facility does not increase the requested Interconnection
Service level. Transmission Provider must evaluate such modifications prior to deeming
them a Material Modification, but only if Interconnection Customer submits them prior to
the return of the executed Facilities Study Agreement by Interconnection Customer to
Transmission Provider. Interconnection Customers requesting that such a modification
be evaluated must demonstrate the required Site Control at the time such request is
made.
4.4.4 Upon receipt of Interconnection Customer’s request for modification permitted
under this Section 4.4, Transmission Provider shall commence and perform any
necessary additional studies as soon as practicable, but in no event shall Transmission
Provider commence such studies later than thirty (30) Calendar Days after receiving
notice of Interconnection Customer’s request. Any additional studies resulting from such
modification shall be done at Interconnection Customer’s cost. Any such request for
modification of the Interconnection Request must be accompanied by any resulting
updates to the models described in Attachment A to Appendix 1 of this LGIP.
4.4.5 Extensions of less than three (3) cumulative years in the Commercial Operation
Date of the Large Generating Facility to which the Interconnection Request relates are
not material and should be handled through construction sequencing. For purposes of
this section, the Commercial Operation Date reflected in the initial Interconnection
Request shall be used to calculate the permissible extension prior to Interconnection
Customer executing an LGIA or requesting that the LGIA be filed unexecuted. After an
LGIA is executed or requested to be filed unexecuted, the Commercial Operation Date
reflected in the LGIA shall be used to calculate the permissible extension. Such
cumulative extensions may not exceed three years including both extensions requested
after execution of the LGIA by Interconnection Customer or the filing of an unexecuted

Section 6. Interconnection Information Access[Feasibility Study]
6.1 Publicly Posted Interconnection Information.
Transmission Provider shall maintain and make publicly available: (1) an interactive
visual representation of the estimated incremental injection capacity (in megawatts)
available at each point of interconnection in Transmission Provider’s footprint under N1 conditions, and (2) a table of metrics concerning the estimated impact of a potential
Generating Facility on Transmission Provider’s Transmission System based on a userspecified addition of a particular number of megawatts at a particular voltage level at a
particular point of interconnection. At a minimum, for each transmission facility
impacted by the user-specified megawatt addition, the following information will be
provided in the table: (1) the distribution factor; (2) the megawatt impact (based on the
megawatt values of the proposed Generating Facility and the distribution factor); (3) the
percentage impact on each impacted transmission facility (based on the megawatt values
of the proposed Generating Facility and the facility rating); (4) the percentage of power
flow on each impacted transmission facility before the injection of the proposed project;
(5) the percentage power flow on each impacted transmission facility after the injection
of the proposed Generating Facility. These metrics must be calculated based on the
power flow model of the Transmission System with the transfer simulated from each point
of interconnection to the whole Transmission Provider’s footprint (to approximate
Network Resource Interconnection Service), and with the incremental capacity at each
point of interconnection decremented by the existing and queued Generating Facilities
(based on the existing or requested interconnection service limit of the generation).
These metrics must be updated within thirty (30) Calendar Days after the completion of
each Cluster Study and Cluster Restudy. This information must be publicly posted,
without a password or a fee. The website will define all underlying assumptions,
including the name of the most recent Cluster Study or Restudy used in the Base Case.

13.4 Third Parties Conducting Studies.
If (i) at the time of the signing of an Interconnection Study Agreement there is
disagreement as to the estimated time to complete an Interconnection Study, (ii)
Interconnection Customer receives notice pursuant to Sections 6.3, 7.4 or 8.3 that
Transmission Provider will not complete an Interconnection Study within the applicable
timeframe for such Interconnection Study, or (iii) Interconnection Customer receives
neither the Interconnection Study nor a notice under Sections 6.3, 7.4 or 8.3 within the
applicable timeframe for such Interconnection Study, then Interconnection Customer may
require Transmission Provider to utilize a third party consultant reasonably acceptable to
Interconnection Customer and Transmission Provider to perform such Interconnection
Study under the direction of Transmission Provider. At other times, Transmission
Provider may also utilize a third party consultant to perform such Interconnection Study,
either in response to a general request of Interconnection Customer, or on its own
volition.
In all cases, use of a third party consultant shall be in accord with Article 26 of the LGIA
(Subcontractors) and limited to situations where Transmission Provider determines that
doing so will help maintain or accelerate the study process for Interconnection
Customer's pending Interconnection Request and not interfere with Transmission
Provider's progress on Interconnection Studies for other pending Interconnection
Requests. In cases where Interconnection Customer requests use of a third party
consultant to perform such Interconnection Study, Interconnection Customer and
Transmission Provider shall negotiate all of the pertinent terms and conditions, including
reimbursement arrangements and the estimated study completion date and study review
deadline. Transmission Provider shall convey all workpapers, data bases, study results
and all other supporting documentation prepared to date with respect to the
Interconnection Request as soon as soon as practicable upon Interconnection Customer's
request subject to the confidentiality provision in Section 13.1. In any case, such third
party contract may be entered into with either Interconnection Customer or Transmission
Provider at Transmission Provider's discretion. In the case of (iii) Interconnection
Customer maintains its right to submit a claim to Dispute Resolution to recover the costs
of such third party study. Such third party consultant shall be required to comply with this
LGIP, Article 26 of the LGIA (Subcontractors), and the relevant Tariff procedures and
protocols as would apply if Transmission Provider were to conduct the Interconnection
Study and shall use the information provided to it solely for purposes of performing such
services and for no other purposes. Transmission Provider shall cooperate with such third
party consultant and Interconnection Customer to complete and issue the Interconnection
Study in the shortest reasonable time.

13.5 Disputes.
13.5.1 Submission.
In the event either Party has a dispute, or asserts a claim, that arises out of or in
connection with the LGIA, the LGIP, or their performance, such Party (the "disputing
Party") shall provide the other Party with written notice of the dispute or claim ("Notice
of Dispute"). Such dispute or claim shall be referred to a designated senior representative
of each Party for resolution on an informal basis as promptly as practicable after receipt
of the Notice of Dispute by the other Party. In the event the designated representatives are
unable to resolve the claim or dispute through unassisted or assisted negotiations within
thirty (30) Calendar Days of the other Party's receipt of the Notice of Dispute, such claim
or dispute may, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, be submitted to arbitration and
resolved in accordance with the arbitration procedures set forth below. In the event the
Parties do not agree to submit such claim or dispute to arbitration, each Party may
exercise whatever rights and remedies it may have in equity or at law consistent with the
terms of this LGIA.
13.5.2 External Arbitration Procedures.
Any arbitration initiated under these procedures shall be conducted before a single neutral
arbitrator appointed by the Parties. If the Parties fail to agree upon a single arbitrator
within ten (10) Calendar Days of the submission of the dispute to arbitration, each Party
shall choose one arbitrator who shall sit on a three-member arbitration panel. The two
arbitrators so chosen shall within twenty (20) Calendar Days select a third arbitrator to
chair the arbitration panel. In either case, the arbitrators shall be knowledgeable in
electric utility matters, including electric transmission and bulk power issues, and shall
not have any current or past substantial business or financial relationships with any party
to the arbitration (except prior arbitration). The arbitrator(s) shall provide each of the
Parties an opportunity to be heard and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall conduct
the arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("Arbitration Rules") and any applicable FERC regulations or
RTO rules; provided, however, in the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules
and the terms of this Section 13, the terms of this Section 13 shall prevail.
13.5.3 Arbitration Decisions.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the arbitrator(s) shall render a decision within
ninety (90) Calendar Days of appointment and shall notify the Parties in writing of such
decision and the reasons therefor. The arbitrator(s) shall be authorized only to interpret
and apply the provisions of the LGIA and LGIP and shall have no power to modify or
change any provision of the LGIA and LGIP in any manner. The decision of the
arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment on the award may

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 79 -

be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator(s) may be
appealed solely on the grounds that the conduct of the arbitrator(s), or the decision itself,
violated the standards set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act or the Administrative
Dispute Resolution Act. The final decision of the arbitrator must also be filed with FERC
if it affects jurisdictional rates, terms and conditions of service, Interconnection Facilities,
or Network Upgrades.
13.5.4 Costs.
Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs incurred during the arbitration process
and for the following costs, if applicable: (1) the cost of the arbitrator chosen by the Party
to sit on the three member panel and one half of the cost of the third arbitrator chosen; or
(2) one half the cost of the single arbitrator jointly chosen by the Parties.
13.5.5 Non-binding dispute resolution procedures.
If a Party has submitted a Notice of Dispute pursuant to S[s]ection 13.5.1, and the Parties
are unable to resolve the claim or dispute through unassisted or assisted negotiations
within the thirty (30) Calendar Days provided in that section, and the Parties cannot reach
mutual agreement to pursue the S[s]ection 13.5 arbitration process, a Party may request
that Transmission Provider engage in Non-binding Dispute Resolution pursuant to this
section by providing written notice to Transmission Provider (“Request for Non-binding
Dispute Resolution”). Conversely, either Party may file a Request for Non-binding
Dispute Resolution pursuant to this section without first seeking mutual agreement to
pursue the S[s]ection 13.5 arbitration process. The process in S[s]ection 13.5.5 shall serve
as an alternative to, and not a replacement of, the section 13.5 arbitration process.
Pursuant to this process, a Transmission Provider must within 30 days of receipt of the
Request for Non-binding Dispute Resolution appoint a neutral decision-maker that is an
independent subcontractor that shall not have any current or past substantial business or
financial relationships with either Party. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the
decision-maker shall render a decision within sixty (60) Calendar Days of appointment
and shall notify the Parties in writing of such decision and reasons therefore. This
decision-maker shall be authorized only to interpret and apply the provisions of the LGIP
and LGIA and shall have no power to modify or change any provision of the LGIP and
LGIA in any manner. The result reached in this process is not binding, but, unless
otherwise agreed, the Parties may cite the record and decision in the non-binding dispute
resolution process in future dispute resolution processes, including in a S[s]ection 13.5
arbitration, or in a Federal Power Act section 206 complaint. Each Party shall be
responsible for its own costs incurred during the process and the cost of the decisionmaker shall be divided equally among each Party to the dispute

13.6 Local Furnishing Bonds.
13.6.1 Transmission Providers That Own Facilities Financed by Local Furnishing
Bonds.
This provision is applicable only to a Transmission Provider that has financed facilities
for the local furnishing of electric energy with tax-exempt bonds, as described in Section
142(f) of the Internal Revenue Code ("local furnishing bonds"). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this LGIA and LGIP, Transmission Provider shall not be required to
provide Interconnection Service to Interconnection Customer pursuant to this LGIA and
LGIP if the provision of such Transmission Service would jeopardize the tax-exempt
status of any local furnishing bond(s) used to finance Transmission Provider’s facilities
that would be used in providing such Interconnection Service.
13.6.2 Alternative Procedures for Requesting Interconnection Service.
If Transmission Provider determines that the provision of Interconnection Service
requested by Interconnection Customer would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any
local furnishing bond(s) used to finance its facilities that would be used in providing such
Interconnection Service, it shall advise the Interconnection Customer within thirty (30)
Calendar Days of receipt of the Interconnection Request.
Interconnection Customer thereafter may renew its request for interconnection using the
process specified in Article 5.2(ii) of the Transmission Provider’s Tariff.
Section [9]13.7 Engineering & Procurement (‘E&P’) Agreement.
Prior to executing an LGIA, an Interconnection Customer may, in order to advance the
implementation of its interconnection, request and Transmission Provider shall offer
Interconnection Customer, an E&P Agreement that authorizes Transmission Provider to
begin engineering and procurement of long lead-time items necessary for the
establishment of the interconnection. However, Transmission Provider shall not be
obligated to offer an E&P Agreement if Interconnection Customer is in Dispute
Resolution as a result of an allegation that Interconnection Customer has failed to meet
any milestones or comply with any prerequisites specified in other parts of the LGIP.
The E&P Agreement is an optional procedure and it will not alter Interconnection
Customer's Queue Position or In-Service Date. The E&P Agreement shall provide for
Interconnection Customer to pay the cost of all activities authorized by Interconnection
Customer and to make advance payments or provide other satisfactory security for such
costs.
Interconnection Customer shall pay the cost of such authorized activities and any
cancellation costs for equipment that is already ordered for its interconnection, which

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

cannot be mitigated as hereafter described, whether or not such items or equipment later
become unnecessary. If Interconnection Customer withdraws its Interconnection Request
or either Party terminates the E&P Agreement, to the extent the equipment ordered can
be canceled under reasonable terms, Interconnection Customer shall be obligated to pay
the associated cancellation costs. To the extent that the equipment cannot be reasonably
canceled, Transmission Provider may elect: (i) to take title to the equipment, in which
event Transmission Provider shall refund Interconnection Customer any amounts paid by
Interconnection Customer for such equipment and shall pay the cost of delivery of such
equipment, or (ii) to transfer title to and deliver such equipment to Interconnection
Customer, in which event Interconnection Customer shall pay any unpaid balance and
cost of delivery of such equipment.

MODELS FOR NON-SYNCHRONOUS GENERATORS
For a non-synchronous Large Generating Facility, Interconnection Customer shall
provide (1) a validated user-defined root mean squared (RMS) positive sequence
dynamics model; (2) an appropriately parameterized generic library RMS positive
sequence dynamics model, including model block diagram of the inverter control and
plant control systems, as defined by the selection in Table 1 or a model otherwise
approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, that corresponds to
Interconnection Customer’s Large Generating Facility; and (3) if applicable, a validated
electromagnetic transient model if Transmission Provider performs an electromagnetic
transient study as part of the interconnection study process. A user-defined model is a set
of programming code created by equipment manufacturers or developers that captures
the latest features of controllers that are mainly software based and represents the
entities’ control strategies but does not necessarily correspond to any generic library
model. Interconnection Customer must also demonstrate that the model is validated by
providing evidence that the equipment behavior is consistent with the model behavior
(e.g., an attestation from Interconnection Customer that the model accurately represents
the entire Large Generating Facility; attestations from each equipment manufacturer that
the user defined model accurately represents the component of the Large Generating
Facility; or test data).

Interconnection Customer for the installation of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s)
unless (1) Transmission Provider has determined, in good faith, that the payments or
property transfers made by Affected System Interconnection Customer to Transmission
Provider should be reported as income subject to taxation, or (2) any Governmental
Authority directs Transmission Provider to report payments or property as income
subject to taxation. Affected System Interconnection Customer shall reimburse
Transmission Provider for such costs on a fully grossed-up basis, in accordance with this
Article, within thirty (30) Calendar Days of receiving written notification from
Transmission Provider of the amount due, including detail about how the amount was
calculated.
The indemnification obligation shall terminate at the earlier of (1) the expiration of the
ten (10)-year testing period and the applicable statute of limitation, as it may be extended
by Transmission Provider upon request of the Internal Revenue Service, to keep these
years open for audit or adjustment, or (2) the occurrence of a subsequent taxable event
and the payment of any related indemnification obligations as contemplated by this
Article. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 3.3.1, and to the extent
permitted by law, to the extent that the receipt of such payments by Transmission
Provider is determined by any Governmental Authority to constitute income by
Transmission Provider subject to taxation, Affected System Interconnection Customer
shall protect, indemnify, and hold harmless Transmission Provider and its Affiliates, from
all claims by any such Governmental Authority for any tax, interest, and/or penalties
associated with such determination. Upon receiving written notification of such
determination from the Governmental Authority, Transmission Provider shall provide
Affected System Interconnection Customer with written notification within thirty (30)
Calendar Days of such determination and notification. Transmission Provider, upon the
timely written request by Affected System Interconnection Customer and at Affected
System Interconnection Customer’s expense, shall appeal, protest, seek abatement of, or
otherwise oppose such determination. Transmission Provider reserves the right to make
all decisions with regard to the prosecution of such appeal, protest, abatement or other
contest, including the compromise or settlement of the claim; provided that Transmission
Provider shall cooperate and consult in good faith with Affected System Interconnection
Customer regarding the conduct of such contest. Affected System Interconnection
Customer shall not be required to pay Transmission Provider for the tax, interest, and/or
penalties prior to the seventh (7th) Calendar Day before the date on which Transmission
Provider (1) is required to pay the tax, interest, and/or penalties or other amount in lieu
thereof pursuant to a compromise or settlement of the appeal, protest, abatement, or
other contest; (2) is required to pay the tax, interest, and/or penalties as the result of a
final, non-appealable order by a Governmental Authority; or (3) is required to pay the

tax, interest, and/or penalties as a prerequisite to an appeal, protest, abatement, or other
contest. In the event such appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest results in a
determination that Transmission Provider is not liable for any portion of any tax,
interest, and/or penalties for which Affected System Interconnection Customer has
already made payment to Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider shall promptly
refund to Affected System Interconnection Customer any payment attributable to the
amount determined to be non-taxable, plus any interest (calculated in accordance with
18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii)) or other payments Transmission Provider receives or which
Transmission Provider may be entitled with respect to such payment. Affected System
Interconnection Customer shall provide Transmission Provider with credit assurances
sufficient to meet Affected System Interconnection Customer’s estimated liability for
reimbursement of Transmission Provider for taxes, interest, and/or penalties under this
Article 3.3.1. Such estimated liability shall be stated in Appendix A.
To the extent that Transmission Provider is a limited liability company and not a
corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a partnership, then the following shall apply:
Transmission Provider represents, and the Parties acknowledge, that Transmission
Provider is a limited liability company and is treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes. Any payment made by Affected System Interconnection Customer to
Transmission Provider for Affected System Network Upgrade(s) is to be treated as an
upfront payment. It is anticipated by the Parties that any amounts paid by Affected
System Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) will be reimbursed to Affected System Interconnection Customer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided Affected System Interconnection
Customer fulfills its obligations under this Agreement.
3.3.2 Private Letter Ruling. At Affected System Interconnection Customer’s request
and expense, Transmission Provider shall file with the Internal Revenue Service a
request for a private letter ruling as to whether any property transferred or sums paid, or
to be paid, by Affected System Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under
this Agreement are subject to federal income taxation. Affected System Interconnection
Customer will prepare the initial draft of the request for a private letter ruling and will
certify under penalties of perjury that all facts represented in such request are true and
accurate to the best of Affected System Interconnection Customer’s knowledge.
Transmission Provider and Affected System Interconnection Customer shall cooperate in
good faith with respect to the submission of such request.
3.3.3 Other Taxes. Upon the timely request by Affected System Interconnection
Customer, and at Affected System Interconnection Customer’s sole expense,
Transmission Provider shall appeal, protest, seek abatement of, or otherwise contest any
tax (other than federal or state income tax) asserted or assessed against Transmission
Provider for which Affected System Interconnection Customer may be required to
reimburse Transmission Provider under the terms of this Agreement. Affected System

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

- 131 -

Interconnection Customer shall pay to Transmission Provider on a periodic basis, as
invoiced by Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider’s documented reasonable
costs of prosecuting such appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest. Affected System
Interconnection Customer and Transmission Provider shall cooperate in good faith with
respect to any such contest. Unless the payment of such taxes is a prerequisite to an
appeal or abatement or cannot be deferred, no amount shall be payable by Affected
System Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for such taxes until they are
assessed by a final, non-appealable order by any court or agency of competent
jurisdiction. In the event that a tax payment is withheld and ultimately due and payable
after appeal, Affected System Interconnection Customer will be responsible for all taxes,
interest and penalties, other than penalties attributable to any delay caused by
Transmission Provider. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party to maintain
each Party’s tax status. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to adversely affect any
Party’s tax-exempt status with respect to the issuance of bonds including, but not limited
to, local furnishing bonds, as described in section 142(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.
ARTICLE 4
SECURITY, BILLING, AND PAYMENTS
4.1
Provision of Security. By the earlier of (1) thirty (30) Calendar Days prior to the
due date for Affected System Interconnection Customer’s first payment under the
payment schedule specified in Appendix A, or (2) the first date specified in Appendix A

Network Upgrade(s), Affected System Interconnection Customer shall provide
Transmission Provider, at Affected System Interconnection Customer's option, a
guarantee, a surety bond, letter of credit or other form of security that is reasonably
acceptable to Transmission Provider. Such security for payment shall be in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs for constructing, procuring, and installing the applicable
portion of Affected System Network Upgrade(s) and shall be reduced on a dollar-fordollar basis for payments made to Transmission Provider for these purposes.
The guarantee must be made by an entity that meets the creditworthiness requirements of
Transmission Provider and contain terms and conditions that guarantee payment of any
amount that may be due from Affected System Interconnection Customer, up to an
agreed-to maximum amount. The letter of credit must be issued by a financial institution
reasonably acceptable to Transmission Provider and must specify a reasonable
expiration date. The surety bond must be issued by an insurer reasonably acceptable to
Transmission Provider and must specify a reasonable expiration date.
4.2
Invoice. Each Party shall submit to the other Party, on a monthly basis, invoices
of amounts due, if any, for the preceding month. Each invoice shall state the month to
which the invoice applies and fully describe the services and equipment provided. The

other Party under this Agreement, including interest payments, shall be netted so that
only the net amount remaining due shall be paid by the owing Party.
4.3
Payment. Invoices shall be rendered to the paying Party at the address specified
by the Parties. The Party receiving the invoice shall pay the invoice within thirty (30)
Calendar Days of receipt. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds
payable to the other Party, or by wire transfer to a bank named and account designated
by the invoicing Party. Payment of invoices by a Party will not constitute a waiver of any
rights or claims that Party may have under this Agreement.
4.4
Final Invoice. Within six (6) months after completion of the construction of the
Affected System Network Upgrade(s), Transmission Provider shall provide an invoice of
the final cost of the construction of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) and shall set
forth such costs in sufficient detail to enable Affected System Interconnection Customer to
compare the actual costs with the estimates and to ascertain deviations, if any, from the
cost estimates. Transmission Provider shall refund, with interest (calculated in
accordance with 18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii)), to Affected System Interconnection Customer
any amount by which the actual payment by Affected System Interconnection Customer
for estimated costs exceeds the actual costs of construction within thirty (30) Calendar
Days of the issuance of such final construction invoice.
4.5
Interest. Interest on any unpaid amounts shall be calculated in accordance with
18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii).
4.6
Payment During Dispute. In the event of a billing dispute among the Parties,
Transmission Provider shall continue to construct the Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) under this Agreement as long as Affected System Interconnection Customer:
(1) continues to make all payments not in dispute; and (2) pays to Transmission Provider
or into an independent escrow account the portion of the invoice in dispute, pending
resolution of such dispute. If Affected System Interconnection Customer fails to meet
these two requirements, then Transmission Provider may provide notice to Affected
System Interconnection Customer of a Default pursuant to Article 5. Within thirty (30)
Calendar Days after the resolution of the dispute, the Party that owes money to another
Party shall pay the amount due with interest calculated in accordance with the
methodology set forth in 18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii).

the services of subcontractors, as it deems appropriate, to perform its obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall require its subcontractors to
comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement in providing such
services, and each Party shall remain primarily liable to the other Party for the
performance of such subcontractor.
7.1.1 Responsibility of Principal. The creation of any subcontract relationship shall
not relieve the hiring Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. In accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, each Party shall be fully responsible to the other

CONFIDENTIALITY

8.1
Confidentiality. Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all
information relating to a Party’s technology, research and development, business affairs,
and pricing, and any information supplied to the other Party prior to the execution of this
Agreement.
Information is Confidential Information only if it is clearly designated or marked in
writing as confidential on the face of the document, or, if the information is conveyed
orally or by inspection, if the Party providing the information orally informs the Party
receiving the information that the information is confidential. The Parties shall maintain
as confidential any information that is provided and identified by a Party as Critical
Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as that term is defined in 18 CFR 388.113(c).
Such confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with this Article 8. If requested by
the receiving Party, the disclosing Party shall provide in writing, the basis for asserting
that the information referred to in this Article warrants confidential treatment, and the
requesting Party may disclose such writing to the appropriate Governmental Authority.
Each Party shall be responsible for the costs associated with affording confidential
treatment to its information.
8.1.1 Term. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) years after
the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this
Article 8 or with regard to CEII, each Party shall hold in confidence and shall not
disclose to any person Confidential Information. CEII shall be treated in accordance
with FERC policies and regulations.
8.1.2 Scope. Confidential Information shall not include information that the receiving
Party can demonstrate: (1) is generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the receiving Party; (2) was in the lawful possession of the receiving Party
on a non-confidential basis before receiving it from the disclosing Party; (3) was
supplied to the receiving Party without restriction by a non-Party, who, to the knowledge
of the receiving Party after due inquiry, was under no obligation to the disclosing Party
to keep such information confidential; (4) was independently developed by the receiving
Party without reference to Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; (5) is, or
becomes, publicly known, through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party or
Breach of this Agreement; or (6) is required, in accordance with Article 8.1.6 of this
Agreement, to be disclosed by any Governmental Authority or is otherwise required to be
disclosed by law or subpoena, or is necessary in any legal proceeding establishing rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Information designated as Confidential
Information will no longer be deemed confidential if the Party that designated the
information as confidential notifies the receiving Party that it no longer is confidential.

8.1.3 Release of Confidential Information. No Party shall release or disclose
Confidential Information to any other person, except to its Affiliates (limited by the
Standards of Conduct requirements), subcontractors, employees, agents, consultants, or
to non-Parties that may be or are considering providing financing to or equity
participation with Affected System Interconnection Customer, or to potential purchasers
or assignees of Affected System Interconnection Customer, on a need-to-know basis in
connection with this Agreement, unless such person has first been advised of the
confidentiality provisions of this Article 8 and has agreed to comply with such provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party providing Confidential Information to any person
shall remain primarily responsible for any release of Confidential Information in
contravention of this Article 8.
8.1.4 Rights. Each Party shall retain all rights, title, and interest in the Confidential
Information that it discloses to the receiving Party. The disclosure by a Party to the
receiving Party of Confidential Information shall not be deemed a waiver by the
disclosing Party or any other person or entity of the right to protect the Confidential
Information from public disclosure.
8.1.5 Standard of Care. Each Party shall use at least the same standard of care to
protect Confidential Information it receives as it uses to protect its own Confidential
Information from unauthorized disclosure, publication, or dissemination. Each Party
may use Confidential Information solely to fulfill its obligations to the other Party under
this Agreement or its regulatory requirements.
8.1.6 Order of Disclosure. If a court or a Government Authority or entity with the
right, power, and apparent authority to do so requests or requires either Party, by
subpoena, oral deposition, interrogatories, requests for production of documents,
administrative order, or otherwise, to disclose Confidential Information, that Party shall
provide the disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request(s) or requirement(s) so
that the disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the absence of a protective order or
waiver, the Party may disclose such Confidential Information which, in the opinion of its
counsel, the Party is legally compelled to disclose. Each Party will use Reasonable
Efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any
Confidential Information so furnished.
8.1.7 Termination of Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason,
each Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request from the
other Party, use Reasonable Efforts to destroy, erase, or delete (with such destruction,
erasure, and deletion certified in writing to the requesting Party) or return to the
requesting Party any and all written or electronic Confidential Information received from
the requesting Party, except that each Party may keep one copy for archival purposes,

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 138 -

provided that the obligation to treat it as Confidential Information in accordance with
this Article 8 shall survive such termination.
8.1.8 Remedies. The Parties agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to
compensate a Party for the other Party’s Breach of its obligations under this Article 8.
Each Party accordingly agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable
relief, by way of injunction or otherwise, if the receiving Party Breaches or threatens to
Breach its obligations under this Article 8, which equitable relief shall be granted
without bond or proof of damages, and the breaching Party shall not plead in defense
that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Such remedy shall not be deemed an
exclusive remedy for the Breach of this Article 8, but it shall be in addition to all other
remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that
the covenants contained herein are necessary for the protection of legitimate business
interests and are reasonable in scope. Neither Party, however, shall be liable for
indirect, incidental, or consequential or punitive damages of any nature or kind resulting
from or arising in connection with this Article 8.
8.1.9 Disclosure to FERC, its Staff, or a State Regulatory Body. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR 1b.20, if FERC or its
staff, during the course of an investigation or otherwise, requests information from a
Party that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this
Agreement, the Party shall provide the requested information to FERC or its staff, within
the time provided for in the request for information. In providing the information to
FERC or its staff, the Party must, consistent with 18 CFR 388.112, request that the
information be treated as confidential and non-public by FERC and its staff and that the
information be withheld from public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the
other Party to this Agreement prior to the release of the Confidential Information to
FERC or its staff. The Party shall notify the other Party to the Agreement when it is
notified by FERC or its staff that a request to release Confidential Information has been
received by FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such
information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112. Requests from a state
regulatory body conducting a confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar
manner if consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.
8.1.10 Subject to the exception in Article 8.1.9, any information that a disclosing Party
claims is competitively sensitive, commercial, or financial information under this
Agreement shall not be disclosed by the receiving Party to any person not employed or
retained by the receiving Party, except to the extent disclosure is (1) required by law; (2)
reasonably deemed by the disclosing Party to be required to be disclosed in connection
with a dispute between or among the Parties, or the defense of litigation or dispute;
(3) otherwise permitted by consent of the disclosing Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; or (4) necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or
as the Transmission Provider or a balancing authority, including disclosing the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 139 -

Confidential Information to a regional or national reliability organization. The Party
asserting confidentiality shall notify the receiving Party in writing of the information that
Party claims is confidential. Prior to any disclosures of that Party’s Confidential
Information under this subparagraph, or if any non-Party or Governmental Authority
makes any request or demand for any of the information described in this subparagraph,
the Party that received the Confidential Information from the disclosing Party agrees to
promptly notify the disclosing Party in writing and agrees to assert confidentiality and
cooperate with the disclosing Party in seeking to protect the Confidential Information
from public disclosure by confidentiality agreement, protective order, or other
reasonable measures.
ARTICLE 9

9.1
Information Access. Each Party shall make available to the other Party
information necessary to verify the costs incurred by the other Party for which the

3.1.2.2 Recommencing of Work. If Affected System Interconnection Customers request
that Transmission Provider recommence construction of Affected System Network
Upgrade(s), Transmission Provider shall have no obligation to afford such work the
priority it would have had but for the prior actions of Affected System Interconnection
Customers to suspend the work. In such event, Affected System Interconnection
Customers shall be responsible for any costs incurred in recommencing the work. All
recommenced work shall be completed pursuant to an amended schedule for the
interconnection agreed to by the Parties. Transmission Provider has the right to conduct
a restudy of the Affected System Study if conditions have materially changed subsequent
to the request to suspend. Affected System Interconnection Customers shall be
responsible for the costs of any studies or restudies required.
3.1.2.3 Right to Suspend Due to Default. Transmission Provider reserves the right,
upon written notice to Affected System Interconnection Customers, to suspend, at any
time, work by Transmission Provider due to a Default by Affected System Interconnection
Customer(s). Defaulting Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) shall be
responsible for any additional expenses incurred by Transmission Provider associated
with the construction and installation of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) (as set
forth in Article 2.2.3) upon the occurrence of a Default pursuant to Article 5. Any form
of suspension by Transmission Provider shall not be barred by Articles 2.2.2, 2.2.3, or
5.2.2, nor shall it affect Transmission Provider’s right to terminate the work or this
Agreement pursuant to Article 6.
3.1.3 Construction Status. Transmission Provider shall keep Affected System
Interconnection Customers advised periodically as to the progress of its design,
procurement, and construction efforts, as described in Appendix A. An Affected System
Interconnection Customer may, at any time and reasonably, request a progress report
from Transmission Provider. If, at any time, an Affected System Interconnection
Customer determines that the completion of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) will
not be required until after the specified in-service date, such Affected System
Interconnection Customer will provide written notice to all other Parties of such later
date for which the completion of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) would be
required. Transmission Provider may delay the in-service date of the Affected System
Network Upgrade(s) accordingly, but only if agreed to by all other Affected System
Interconnection Customers.
3.1.4 Timely Completion. Transmission Provider shall use Reasonable Efforts to
design, procure, construct, install, and test the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) in
accordance with the schedule set forth in Appendix A, which schedule may be revised
from time to time by mutual agreement of the Parties. If any event occurs that will affect
the time or ability to complete the Affected System Network Upgrade(s), Transmission
Provider shall promptly notify all other Parties. In such circumstances, Transmission
Provider shall, within fifteen (15) Calendar Days of such notice, convene a meeting with

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 153 -

Affected System Interconnection Customers to evaluate the alternatives available to
Affected System Interconnection Customers. Transmission Provider shall also make
available to Affected System Interconnection Customers all studies and work papers
related to the event and corresponding delay, including all information that is in the
possession of Transmission Provider that is reasonably needed by Affected System
Interconnection Customers to evaluate alternatives, subject to confidentiality
arrangements consistent with Article 8. Transmission Provider shall, at any Affected
System Interconnection Customer’s request and expense, use Reasonable Efforts to
accelerate its work under this Agreement to meet the schedule set forth in Appendix A,
provided that (1) Affected System Interconnection Customers jointly authorize such
actions, such authorizations to be withheld, conditioned, or delayed by a given Affected
System Interconnection Customer only if it can demonstrate that the acceleration would
have a material adverse effect on it; and (2) the requesting Affected System
Interconnection Customer(s) funds the costs associated therewith in advance, or all
Affected System Interconnection Customers agree in advance to fund such costs based on
such other allocation method as they may adopt.
3.2

Interconnection Costs.

3.2.1 Costs. Affected System Interconnection Customers shall pay to Transmission
Provider costs (including taxes and financing costs) associated with seeking and
obtaining all necessary approvals and of designing, engineering, constructing, and
testing the Affected System Network Upgrade(s), as identified in Appendix A, in
accordance with the cost recovery method provided herein. Except as expressly
otherwise agreed, Affected System Interconnection Customers shall be collectively
responsible for these costs, based on their proportionate share of cost responsibility, as
provided in Appendix A. Unless Transmission Provider elects to fund the Affected System
Network Upgrade(s), they shall be initially funded by the applicable Affected System
Interconnection Customer.
3.2.1.1 Lands of Other Property Owners. If any part of the Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) is to be installed on property owned by persons other than Affected System
Interconnection Customers or Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider shall, at
Affected System Interconnection Customers’ expense, use efforts similar in nature and
extent to those that it typically undertakes on its own behalf or on behalf of its Affiliates,
including use of its eminent domain authority to the extent permitted and consistent with
Applicable Laws and Regulations and, to the extent consistent with such Applicable Laws
and Regulations, to procure from such persons any rights of use, licenses, rights-of-way,
and easements that are necessary to construct, operate, maintain, test, inspect, replace,
or remove the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) upon such property.
3.2.2 Repayment.

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 154 -

3.2.2.1 Repayment. Consistent with articles 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the Transmission
Provider’s pro forma LGIA, each Affected System Interconnection Customer shall be
entitled to a cash repayment by Transmission Provider of the amount each Affected
System Interconnection Customer paid to Transmission Provider, if any, for the Affected
System Network Upgrade(s), including any tax gross-up or other tax-related payments
associated with the Affected System Network Upgrade(s), and not refunded to Affected
System Interconnection Customer pursuant to Article 3.3.1 or otherwise. The Parties
may mutually agree to a repayment schedule, to be outlined in Appendix A, not to exceed
twenty (20) years from the commercial operation date, for the complete repayment for all
applicable costs associated with the Affected System Network Upgrade(s). Any
repayment shall include interest calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth
in FERC’s regulations at 18 CFR 35.19 a(a)(2)(iii) from the date of any payment for
Affected System Network Upgrade(s) through the date on which Affected System
Interconnection Customers receive a repayment of such payment pursuant to this
subparagraph. Interest shall not accrue during periods in which Affected System
Interconnection Customers have suspended construction pursuant to Article 3.1.2.1.
Affected System Interconnection Customers may assign such repayment rights to any
person.
3.2.2.2 Impact of Failure to Achieve Commercial Operation. If an Affected System
Interconnection Customer’s generating facility fails to achieve commercial operation,
but it or another generating facility is later constructed and makes use of the Affected
System Network Upgrade(s), Transmission Provider shall at that time reimburse such
Affected System Interconnection Customers for the portion of the Affected System
Network Upgrade(s) it funded. Before any such reimbursement can occur, Affected
System Interconnection Customer (or the entity that ultimately constructs the
generating facility, if different), is responsible for identifying the entity to which the
reimbursement must be made.
3.3

Taxes.

3.3.1 Indemnification for Contributions in Aid of Construction. With regard only to
payments made by Affected System Interconnection Customers to Transmission Provider
for the installation of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s), Transmission Provider
shall not include a gross-up for income taxes in the amounts it charges Affected System
Interconnection Customers for the installation of the Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) unless (1) Transmission Provider has determined, in good faith, that the
payments or property transfers made by Affected System Interconnection Customers to
Transmission Provider should be reported as income subject to taxation, or (2) any
Governmental Authority directs Transmission Provider to report payments or property as
income subject to taxation. Affected System Interconnection Customers shall reimburse
Transmission Provider for such costs on a fully grossed-up basis, in accordance with this
Article, within thirty (30) Calendar Days of receiving written notification from

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 155 -

Transmission Provider of the amount due, including detail about how the amount was
calculated.
The indemnification obligation shall terminate at the earlier of (1) the expiration of the
ten (10)-year testing period and the applicable statute of limitation, as it may be extended
by Transmission Provider upon request of the Internal Revenue Service, to keep these
years open for audit or adjustment, or (2) the occurrence of a subsequent taxable event
and the payment of any related indemnification obligations as contemplated by this
Article. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 3.3.1, and to the extent
permitted by law, to the extent that the receipt of such payments by Transmission
Provider is determined by any Governmental Authority to constitute income by
Transmission Provider subject to taxation, Affected System Interconnection Customers
shall protect, indemnify, and hold harmless Transmission Provider and its Affiliates, from
all claims by any such Governmental Authority for any tax, interest, and/or penalties
associated with such determination. Upon receiving written notification of such
determination from the Governmental Authority, Transmission Provider shall provide
Affected System Interconnection Customers with written notification within thirty (30)
Calendar Days of such determination and notification. Transmission Provider, upon the
timely written request by any one or more Affected System Interconnection Customer(s)
and at the expense of such Affected System Interconnection Customer(s), shall appeal,
protest, seek abatement of, or otherwise oppose such determination. Transmission
Provider reserves the right to make all decisions with regard to the prosecution of such
appeal, protest, abatement or other contest, including the compromise or settlement of
the claim; provided that Transmission Provider shall cooperate and consult in good faith
with the requesting Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) regarding the conduct
of such contest. Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) shall not be required to
pay Transmission Provider for the tax, interest, and/or penalties prior to the seventh
(7th) Calendar Day before the date on which Transmission Provider (1) is required to
pay the tax, interest, and/or penalties or other amount in lieu thereof pursuant to a
compromise or settlement of the appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest; (2) is
required to pay the tax, interest, and/or penalties as the result of a final, non-appealable
order by a Governmental Authority; or (3) is required to pay the tax, interest, and/or
penalties as a prerequisite to an appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest. In the
event such appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest results in a determination that
Transmission Provider is not liable for any portion of any tax, interest, and/or penalties
for which any Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) has already made payment to
Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider shall promptly refund to such Affected
System Interconnection Customer(s) any payment attributable to the amount determined
to be non-taxable, plus any interest (calculated in accordance with 18 CFR
35.19a(a)(2)(iii)) or other payments Transmission Provider receives or to which
Transmission Provider may be entitled with respect to such payment. Each Affected
System Interconnection Customer shall provide Transmission Provider with credit
assurances sufficient to meet each Affected System Interconnection Customer’s estimated

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 156 -

liability for reimbursement of Transmission Provider for taxes, interest, and/or penalties
under this Article 3.3.1. Such estimated liability shall be stated in Appendix A.
To the extent that Transmission Provider is a limited liability company and not a
corporation, and has elected to be taxed as a partnership, then the following shall apply:
Transmission Provider represents, and the Parties acknowledge, that Transmission
Provider is a limited liability company and is treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes. Any payment made by Affected System Interconnection Customers to
Transmission Provider for Affected System Network Upgrade(s) is to be treated as an
upfront payment. It is anticipated by the Parties that any amounts paid by each Affected
System Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) will be reimbursed to such Affected System Interconnection Customer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided such Affected System
Interconnection Customer fulfills its obligations under this Agreement.
3.3.2 Private Letter Ruling. At the request and expense of any Affected System
Interconnection Customer(s), Transmission Provider shall file with the Internal Revenue
Service a request for a private letter ruling as to whether any property transferred or
sums paid, or to be paid, by such Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) to
Transmission Provider under this Agreement are subject to federal income taxation.
Each Affected System Interconnection Customer desiring such a request will prepare the
initial draft of the request for a private letter ruling and will certify under penalties of
perjury that all facts represented in such request are true and accurate to the best of such
Affected System Interconnection Customer’s knowledge. Transmission Provider and
such Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) shall cooperate in good faith with
respect to the submission of such request.
3.3.3 Other Taxes. Upon the timely request by any one or more Affected System
Interconnection Customer(s), and at such Affected System Interconnection Customer(s)’
sole expense, Transmission Provider shall appeal, protest, seek abatement of, or
otherwise contest any tax (other than federal or state income tax) asserted or assessed
against Transmission Provider for which such Affected System Interconnection
Customer(s) may be required to reimburse Transmission Provider under the terms of this
Agreement. Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) who requested the action shall
pay to Transmission Provider on a periodic basis, as invoiced by Transmission Provider,
Transmission Provider’s documented reasonable costs of prosecuting such appeal,
protest, abatement, or other contest. The requesting Affected System Interconnection
Customer(s) and Transmission Provider shall cooperate in good faith with respect to any
such contest. Unless the payment of such taxes is a prerequisite to an appeal or
abatement or cannot be deferred, no amount shall be payable by Affected System
Interconnection Customer(s) to Transmission Provider for such taxes until they are
assessed by a final, non-appealable order by any court or agency of competent
jurisdiction. In the event that a tax payment is withheld and ultimately due and payable

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 157 -

after appeal, Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) will be responsible for all
taxes, interest, and penalties, other than penalties attributable to any delay caused by
Transmission Provider. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party to maintain
each Party’s tax status. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to adversely affect any
Party’s tax-exempt status with respect to the issuance of bonds including, but not limited
to, local furnishing bonds, as described in section 142(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.
ARTICLE 4
SECURITY, BILLING, AND PAYMENTS
4.1
Provision of Security. By the earlier of (1) thirty (30) Calendar Days prior to the
due date for each Affected System Interconnection Customer’s first payment under the
payment schedule specified in Appendix A, or (2) the first date specified in Appendix A
for the ordering of equipment by Transmission Provider for installing the Affected System
Network Upgrade(s), each Affected System Interconnection Customer shall provide
Transmission Provider, at each Affected System Interconnection Customer's option, a
guarantee, a surety bond, letter of credit, or other form of security that is reasonably
acceptable to Transmission Provider. Such security for payment shall be in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs for constructing, procuring, and installing the applicable
portion of Affected System Network Upgrade(s) and shall be reduced on a dollar-fordollar basis for payments made to Transmission Provider for these purposes.
The guarantee must be made by an entity that meets the creditworthiness requirements of
Transmission Provider and contain terms and conditions that guarantee payment of any
amount that may be due from such Affected System Interconnection Customer, up to an
agreed-to maximum amount. The letter of credit must be issued by a financial institution
reasonably acceptable to Transmission Provider and must specify a reasonable
expiration date. The surety bond must be issued by an insurer reasonably acceptable to
Transmission Provider and must specify a reasonable expiration date.
4.2
Invoice. Each Party shall submit to the other Parties, on a monthly basis,
invoices of amounts due, if any, for the preceding month. Each invoice shall state the
month to which the invoice applies and fully describe the services and equipment
provided. The Parties may discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and
owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all amounts a Party
owes to another Party under this Agreement, including interest payments, shall be netted
so that only the net amount remaining due shall be paid by the owing Party.
4.3
Payment. Invoices shall be rendered to the paying Party at the address specified
by the Parties. The Party receiving the invoice shall pay the invoice within thirty (30)
Calendar Days of receipt. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds
payable to the other Party, or by wire transfer to a bank named and account designated

by the invoicing Party. Payment of invoices by a Party will not constitute a waiver of any
rights or claims that Party may have under this Agreement.
4.4
Final Invoice. Within six (6) months after completion of the construction of the
Affected System Network Upgrade(s) Transmission Provider shall provide an invoice of
the final cost of the construction of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) and shall set
forth such costs in sufficient detail to enable each Affected System Interconnection
Customer to compare the actual costs with the estimates and to ascertain deviations, if
any, from the cost estimates. Transmission Provider shall refund, with interest
(calculated in accordance with 18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii)), to each Affected System
Interconnection Customer any amount by which the actual payment by Affected System
Interconnection Customer for estimated costs exceeds the actual costs of construction
within thirty (30) Calendar Days of the issuance of such final construction invoice.
4.5
Interest. Interest on any unpaid amounts shall be calculated in accordance with
18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii).
4.6
Payment During Dispute. In the event of a billing dispute among the Parties,
Transmission Provider shall continue to construct the Affected System Network
Upgrade(s) under this Agreement as long as each Affected System Interconnection
Customer: (1) continues to make all payments not in dispute; and (2) pays to
Transmission Provider or into an independent escrow account the portion of the invoice
in dispute, pending resolution of such dispute. If any Affected System Interconnection
Customer fails to meet these two requirements, then Transmission Provider may provide
notice to such Affected System Interconnection Customer of a Default pursuant to Article
5. Within thirty (30) Calendar Days after the resolution of the dispute, the Party that
owes money to another Party shall pay the amount due with interest calculated in
accordance with the methodology set forth in 18 CFR 35.19a(a)(2)(iii).
ARTICLE 5
BREACH, CURE, AND DEFAULT
5.1

Events of Breach. A Breach of this Agreement shall include the:

(a)

Failure to pay any amount when due;

(b)
Failure to comply with any material term or condition of this Agreement,
including but not limited to any material Breach of a representation, warranty, or
covenant made in this Agreement;
(c)
Failure of a Party to provide such access rights, or a Party’s attempt to revoke
access or terminate such access rights, as provided under this Agreement; or

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 159 -

(d)
Failure of a Party to provide information or data to another Party as required
under this Agreement, provided the Party entitled to the information or data under this
Agreement requires such information or data to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement.
5.2 Definition. Breaching Party shall mean the Party that is in Breach.
5.3 Notice of Breach, Cure, and Default. Upon the occurrence of an event of Breach,
any Party aggrieved by the Breach, when it becomes aware of the Breach, shall give
written notice of the Breach to the Breaching Party and to any other person representing
a Party to this Agreement identified in writing to the other Party in advance. Such notice
shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of the Breach, and where known and
applicable, the steps necessary to cure such Breach.
5.2.1 Upon receiving written notice of the Breach hereunder, the Breaching Party shall
have a period to cure such Breach (hereinafter referred to as the “Cure Period”) which
shall be sixty (60) Calendar Days. If an Affected System Interconnection Customer is the
Breaching Party and the Breach results from a failure to provide payments or security
under Article 4.1 of this Agreement, the other Affected System Interconnection
Customers, either individually or in concert, may cure the Breach by paying the amounts
owed or by providing adequate security, without waiver of contribution rights against the
breaching Affected System Interconnection Customer. Such cure for the Breach of an
Affected System Interconnection Customer is subject to the reasonable consent of
Transmission Provider. Transmission Provider may also cure such Breach by funding
the proportionate share of the Affected System Network Upgrade costs related to the
Breach of Affected System Interconnection Customer. Transmission Provider must notify
all Parties that it will exercise this option within thirty (30) Calendar Days of notification
that an Affected System Interconnection Customer has failed to provide payments or
security under Article 4.1.
5.2.2 In the event the Breach is not cured within the Cure Period, the Breaching Party
will be in Default of this Agreement, and the non-Defaulting Parties may (1) act in
concert to amend the Agreement to remove an Affected System Interconnection Customer
that is in Default from this Agreement for cause and to make other changes as necessary,
or (2) either in concert or individually take whatever action at law or in equity as may
appear necessary or desirable to enforce the performance or observance of any rights,
remedies, obligations, agreement, or covenants under this Agreement.
5.3
Rights in the Event of Default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of Default, the non-Defaulting Parties shall be entitled to exercise all rights
and remedies it may have in equity or at law.

ARTICLE 6
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
6.1
Expiration of Term. Except as otherwise specified in this Article 6, the Parties’
obligations under this Agreement shall terminate at the conclusion of the term of this
Agreement.
6.2
Termination and Removal. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 6.3, in
the event of a Default, termination of this Agreement, as to a given Affected System
Interconnection Customer or in its entirety, shall require a filing at FERC of a notice of
termination, which filing must be accepted for filing by FERC.
6.3

Disposition of Facilities Upon Termination of Agreement.

6.3.1 Transmission Provider Obligations. Upon termination of this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, Transmission Provider:
(a)
shall, prior to the construction and installation of any portion of the Affected
System Network Upgrade(s) and to the extent possible, cancel any pending orders of, or
return, such equipment or material for such Affected System Network Upgrade(s);
(b)
may keep in place any portion of the Affected System Network Upgrade(s) already
constructed and installed; and,
(c)
shall perform such work as may be necessary to ensure the safety of persons and
property and to preserve the integrity of Transmission Provider’s Transmission System
(e.g., construction demobilization to return the system to its original state, wind-up
work).
6.3.2 Affected System Interconnection Customer Obligations. Upon billing by
Transmission Provider, each Affected System Interconnection Customer shall reimburse
Transmission Provider for its share of any costs incurred by Transmission Provider in
performance of the actions required or permitted by Article 6.3.1 and for its share of the
cost of any Affected System Network Upgrade(s) described in Appendix A. Transmission
Provider shall use Reasonable Efforts to minimize costs and shall offset the amounts
owed by any salvage value of facilities, if applicable. Each Affected System
Interconnection Customer shall pay these costs pursuant to Article 4.3 of this Agreement.
6.3.3 Pre-construction or Installation. Upon termination of this Agreement and prior
to the construction and installation of any portion of the Affected System Network
Upgrade(s), Transmission Provider may, at its option, retain any portion of such Affected
System Network Upgrade(s) not cancelled or returned in accordance with
Article 6.3.1(a), in which case Transmission Provider shall be responsible for all costs

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 161 -

associated with procuring such Affected System Network Upgrade(s). To the extent that
an Affected System Interconnection Customer has already paid Transmission Provider
for any or all of such costs, Transmission Provider shall refund Affected System
Interconnection Customer for those payments. If Transmission Provider elects to not
retain any portion of such facilities, and one or more of Affected System Interconnection
Customers wish to purchase such facilities, Transmission Provider shall convey and
make available to the applicable Affected System Interconnection Customer(s) such
facilities as soon as practicable after Affected System Interconnection Customer(s)’
payment for such facilities.
6.4
Survival of Rights. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve
any Party of any of its liabilities and obligations arising hereunder prior to the date
termination becomes effective, and each Party may take whatever judicial or
administrative actions as appear necessary or desirable to enforce its rights hereunder.
The applicable provisions of this Agreement will continue in effect after expiration, or
early termination hereof, to the extent necessary to provide for (1) final billings, billing
adjustments, and other billing procedures set forth in this Agreement; (2) the
determination and enforcement of liability and indemnification obligations arising from
acts or events that occurred while this Agreement was in effect; and (3) the
confidentiality provisions set forth in Article 8.
ARTICLE 7
SUBCONTRACTORS
7.1
Subcontractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from utilizing
the services of subcontractors, as it deems appropriate, to perform its obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall require its subcontractors to
comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement in providing such
services, and each Party shall remain primarily liable to the other Parties for the
performance of such subcontractor.
7.1.1 Responsibility of Principal. The creation of any subcontract relationship shall
not relieve the hiring Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. In accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, each Party shall be fully responsible to the other
Parties for the acts or omissions of any subcontractor it hires as if no subcontract had
been made. Any applicable obligation imposed by this Agreement upon a Party shall be
equally binding upon, and shall be construed as having application to, any subcontractor
of such Party.
7.1.2 No Third-Party Beneficiary. Except as may be specifically set forth to the
contrary herein, no subcontractor or any other party is intended to be, nor will it be
deemed to be, a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

7.1.3 No Limitation by Insurance. The obligations under this Article 7 will not be
limited in any way by any limitation of any insurance policies or coverages, including
any subcontractor’s insurance.
ARTICLE 8
CONFIDENTIALITY
8.1
Confidentiality. Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all
information relating to a Party’s technology, research and development, business affairs,
and pricing, and any information supplied to the other Parties prior to the execution of
this Agreement.
Information is Confidential Information only if it is clearly designated or marked in
writing as confidential on the face of the document, or, if the information is conveyed
orally or by inspection, if the Party providing the information orally informs the Party
receiving the information that the information is confidential. The Parties shall maintain
as confidential any information that is provided and identified by a Party as Critical
Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as that term is defined in 18 CFR 388.113(c).
Such confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with this Article 8. If requested by
the receiving Party, the disclosing Party shall provide in writing, the basis for asserting
that the information referred to in this Article warrants confidential treatment, and the
requesting Party may disclose such writing to the appropriate Governmental Authority.
Each Party shall be responsible for the costs associated with affording confidential
treatment to its information.
8.1.1 Term. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) years after
the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this
Article 8 or with regard to CEII, each Party shall hold in confidence and shall not
disclose to any person Confidential Information. CEII shall be treated in accordance
with FERC policies and regulations.
8.1.2 Scope. Confidential Information shall not include information that the receiving
Party can demonstrate: (1) is generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the receiving Party; (2) was in the lawful possession of the receiving Party
on a non-confidential basis before receiving it from the disclosing Party; (3) was
supplied to the receiving Party without restriction by a non-Party, who, to the knowledge
of the receiving Party after due inquiry, was under no obligation to the disclosing Party
to keep such information confidential; (4) was independently developed by the receiving
Party without reference to Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; (5) is, or
becomes, publicly known, through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party or
Breach of this Agreement; or (6) is required, in accordance with Article 8.1.6 of this
Agreement, to be disclosed by any Governmental Authority or is otherwise required to be

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 163 -

disclosed by law or subpoena, or is necessary in any legal proceeding establishing rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Information designated as Confidential
Information will no longer be deemed confidential if the Party that designated the
information as confidential notifies the receiving Party that it no longer is confidential.
8.1.3 Release of Confidential Information. No Party shall release or disclose
Confidential Information to any other person, except to its Affiliates (limited by the
Standards of Conduct requirements), subcontractors, employees, agents, consultants, or
to non-Parties that may be or are considering providing financing to or equity
participation with Affected System Interconnection Customer(s), or to potential
purchasers or assignees of Affected System Interconnection Customer(s), on a need-toknow basis in connection with this Agreement, unless such person has first been advised
of the confidentiality provisions of this Article 8 and has agreed to comply with such
provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party providing Confidential Information
to any person shall remain primarily responsible for any release of Confidential
Information in contravention of this Article 8.
8.1.4 Rights. Each Party shall retain all rights, title, and interest in the Confidential
Information that it discloses to the receiving Party. The disclosure by a Party to the
receiving Party of Confidential Information shall not be deemed a waiver by the
disclosing Party or any other person or entity of the right to protect the Confidential
Information from public disclosure.
8.1.5 Standard of Care. Each Party shall use at least the same standard of care to
protect Confidential Information it receives as it uses to protect its own Confidential
Information from unauthorized disclosure, publication, or dissemination. Each Party
may use Confidential Information solely to fulfill its obligations to the other Party under
this Agreement or its regulatory requirements.
8.1.6 Order of Disclosure. If a court or a Government Authority or entity with the
right, power, and apparent authority to do so requests or requires any Party, by
subpoena, oral deposition, interrogatories, requests for production of documents,
administrative order, or otherwise, to disclose Confidential Information, that Party shall
provide the disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request(s) or requirement(s) so
that the disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the absence of a protective order or
waiver, the Party may disclose such Confidential Information which, in the opinion of its
counsel, the Party is legally compelled to disclose. Each Party will use Reasonable
Efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any
Confidential Information so furnished.
8.1.7 Termination of Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason,
each Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request from the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 164 -

other Party, use Reasonable Efforts to destroy, erase, or delete (with such destruction,
erasure, and deletion certified in writing to the requesting Party) or return to the
requesting Party any and all written or electronic Confidential Information received from
the requesting Party, except that each Party may keep one copy for archival purposes,
provided that the obligation to treat it as Confidential Information in accordance with
this Article 8 shall survive such termination.
8.1.8 Remedies. The Parties agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to
compensate a Party for another Party’s Breach of its obligations under this Article 8.
Each Party accordingly agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable
relief, by way of injunction or otherwise, if the receiving Party Breaches or threatens to
Breach its obligations under this Article 8, which equitable relief shall be granted
without bond or proof of damages, and the Breaching Party shall not plead in defense
that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Such remedy shall not be deemed an
exclusive remedy for the Breach of this Article 8, but it shall be in addition to all other
remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that
the covenants contained herein are necessary for the protection of legitimate business
interests and are reasonable in scope. No Party, however, shall be liable for indirect,
incidental, or consequential or punitive damages of any nature or kind resulting from or
arising in connection with this Article 8.
8.1.9 Disclosure to FERC, its Staff, or a State Regulatory Body. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR 1b.20, if FERC or its
staff, during the course of an investigation or otherwise, requests information from a
Party that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this
Agreement, the Party shall provide the requested information to FERC or its staff, within
the time provided for in the request for information. In providing the information to
FERC or its staff, the Party must, consistent with 18 CFR 388.112, request that the
information be treated as confidential and non-public by FERC and its staff and that the
information be withheld from public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the
other Parties to this Agreement prior to the release of the Confidential Information to
FERC or its staff. The Party shall notify the other Parties to the Agreement when it is
notified by FERC or its staff that a request to release Confidential Information has been
received by FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such
information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112. Requests from a state
regulatory body conducting a confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar
manner if consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.
8.1.10 Subject to the exception in Article 8.1.9, any information that a disclosing Party
claims is competitively sensitive, commercial, or financial information under this
Agreement shall not be disclosed by the receiving Party to any person not employed or
retained by the receiving Party, except to the extent disclosure is (1) required by law; (2)
reasonably deemed by the disclosing Party to be required to be disclosed in connection

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

with a dispute between or among the Parties, or the defense of litigation or dispute;
(3) otherwise permitted by consent of the disclosing Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; or (4) necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or
as Transmission Provider or a balancing authority, including disclosing the Confidential
Information to a regional or national reliability organization. The Party asserting
confidentiality shall notify the receiving Party in writing of the information that Party
claims is confidential. Prior to any disclosures of that Party’s Confidential Information
under this subparagraph, or if any non-Party or Governmental Authority makes any
request or demand for any of the information described in this subparagraph, the Party
that received the Confidential Information from the disclosing Party agrees to promptly
notify the disclosing Party in writing and agrees to assert confidentiality and cooperate
with the disclosing Party in seeking to protect the Confidential Information from public
disclosure by confidentiality agreement, protective order, or other reasonable measures.
ARTICLE 9
INFORMATION ACCESS AND AUDIT RIGHTS
9.1
Information Access. Each Party shall make available to the other Parties
information necessary to verify the costs incurred by the other Parties for which the

associated with the removal, relocation or other disposition or retirement of
such materials, equipment, or facilities.
2.5

Disconnection. Upon termination of this LGIA, the Parties will take all
appropriate steps to disconnect the Large Generating Facility from the

Scope of Service

Interconnection Product Options. Interconnection Customer has selected the
following (checked) type of Interconnection Service:
4.1.1 Energy Resource Interconnection Service.
4.1.1.1

The Product. Energy Resource Interconnection Service
allows Interconnection Customer to connect the Large
Generating Facility to the Transmission System and be
eligible to deliver the Large Generating Facility's output using
the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the Transmission
System on an "as available" basis. To the extent
Interconnection Customer wants to receive Energy Resource
Interconnection Service, Transmission Provider shall
construct facilities identified in Attachment A.

4.1.1.2

Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Under
Energy Resource Interconnection Service, Interconnection
Customer will be eligible to inject power from the Large
Generating Facility into and deliver power across the
interconnecting Transmission Provider's Transmission
System on an "as available" basis up to the amount of MWs
identified in the applicable stability and steady state studies to
the extent the upgrades initially required to qualify for Energy
Resource Interconnection Service have been constructed.
Where eligible to do so (e.g., PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO),
Interconnection Customer may place a bid to sell into the
market up to the maximum identified Large Generating
Facility output, subject to any conditions specified in the
interconnection service approval, and the Large Generating
Facility will be dispatched to the extent Interconnection

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 190 Customer's bid clears. In all other instances, no transmission
delivery service from the Large Generating Facility is
assured, but Interconnection Customer may obtain Point-toPoint Transmission Service, Network Integration
Transmission Service, or be used for secondary network
transmission service, pursuant to Transmission Provider's
Tariff, up to the maximum output identified in the stability
and steady state studies. In those instances, in order for
Interconnection Customer to obtain the right to deliver or
inject energy beyond the Large Generating Facility Point of
Interconnection or to improve its ability to do so,
transmission delivery service must be obtained pursuant to
the provisions of Transmission Provider's Tariff. The
Interconnection Customer's ability to inject its Large
Generating Facility output beyond the Point of
Interconnection, therefore, will depend on the existing
capacity of Transmission Provider's Transmission System at
such time as a transmission service request is made that
would accommodate such delivery. The provision of firm
Point-to-Point Transmission Service or Network Integration
Transmission Service may require the construction of
additional Network Upgrades.

4.1.2 Network Resource Interconnection Service.
4.1.2.1

The Product. Transmission Provider must conduct the
necessary studies and construct the Network Upgrades needed
to integrate the Large Generating Facility (1) in a manner
comparable to that in which Transmission Provider integrates
its generating facilities to serve native load customers; or (2)
in an ISO or RTO with market based congestion
management, in the same manner as all Network Resources.
To the extent Interconnection Customer wants to receive
Network Resource Interconnection Service, Transmission
Provider shall construct the facilities identified in Attachment
A to this LGIA.

4.1.2.2

Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Network
Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection
Customer's Large Generating Facility to be designated by any
Network Customer under the Tariff on Transmission
Provider's Transmission System as a Network Resource, up to
the Large Generating Facility's full output, on the same basis

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 191 as existing Network Resources interconnected to
Transmission Provider's Transmission System, and to be
studied as a Network Resource on the assumption that such a
designation will occur. Although Network Resource
Interconnection Service does not convey a reservation of
transmission service, any Network Customer under the Tariff
can utilize its network service under the Tariff to obtain
delivery of energy from the interconnected Interconnection
Customer's Large Generating Facility in the same manner as
it accesses Network Resources. A Large Generating Facility
receiving Network Resource Interconnection Service may
also be used to provide Ancillary Services after technical
studies and/or periodic analyses are performed with respect to
the Large Generating Facility's ability to provide any
applicable Ancillary Services, provided that such studies and
analyses have been or would be required in connection with
the provision of such Ancillary Services by any existing
Network Resource. However, if an Interconnection
Customer's Large Generating Facility has not been designated
as a Network Resource by any load, it cannot be required to
provide Ancillary Services except to the extent such
requirements extend to all generating facilities that are
similarly situated. The provision of Network Integration
Transmission Service or firm Point-to-Point Transmission
Service may require additional studies and the construction of
additional upgrades. Because such studies and upgrades
would be associated with a request for delivery service under
the Tariff, cost responsibility for the studies and upgrades
would be in accordance with FERC's policy for pricing
transmission delivery services.
Network Resource Interconnection Service does not
necessarily provide Interconnection Customer with the
capability to physically deliver the output of its Large
Generating Facility to any particular load on Transmission
Provider's Transmission System without incurring congestion
costs. In the event of transmission constraints on
Transmission Provider's Transmission System,
Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility shall be
subject to the applicable congestion management procedures
in Transmission Provider's Transmission System in the same
manner as Network Resources.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 192 There is no requirement either at the time of study or
interconnection, or at any point in the future, that
Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility be
designated as a Network Resource by a Network Service
Customer under the Tariff or that Interconnection Customer
identify a specific buyer (or sink). To the extent a Network
Customer does designate the Large Generating Facility as a
Network Resource, it must do so pursuant to Transmission
Provider's Tariff.
Once an Interconnection Customer satisfies the requirements
for obtaining Network Resource Interconnection Service, any
future transmission service request for delivery from the
Large Generating Facility within Transmission Provider's
Transmission System of any amount of capacity and/or
energy, up to the amount initially studied, will not require that
any additional studies be performed or that any further
upgrades associated with such Large Generating Facility be
undertaken, regardless of whether or not such Large
Generating Facility is ever designated by a Network
Customer as a Network Resource and regardless of changes
in ownership of the Large Generating Facility. However, the
reduction or elimination of congestion or redispatch costs
may require additional studies and the construction of
additional upgrades.
To the extent Interconnection Customer enters into an
arrangement for long term transmission service for deliveries
from the Large Generating Facility outside Transmission
Provider's Transmission System, such request may require
additional studies and upgrades in order for Transmission
Provider to grant such request.

4.2

Provision of Service. Transmission Provider shall provide Interconnection
Service for the Large Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection.

4.3

Performance Standards. Each Party shall perform all of its obligations under
this LGIA in accordance with Applicable Laws and Regulations, Applicable
Reliability Standards, and Good Utility Practice, and to the extent a Party is
required or prevented or limited in taking any action by such regulations and
standards, such Party shall not be deemed to be in Breach of this LGIA for its
compliance therewith. If such Party is a Transmission Provider or Transmission

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 193 -

Owner, then that Party shall amend the LGIA and submit the amendment to FERC
for approval.
4.4

No Transmission Delivery Service. The execution of this LGIA does not
constitute a request for, nor the provision of, any transmission delivery service
under Transmission Provider's Tariff, and does not convey any right to deliver
electricity to any specific customer or Point of Delivery.

4.5

Interconnection Customer Provided Services. The services provided by
Interconnection Customer under this LGIA are set forth in Article 9.6 and Article
13.5.1. Interconnection Customer shall be paid for such services in accordance
with Article 11.6.

Article 5.
5.1

Interconnection Facilities and/or Network Upgrades required under this LGIA
with the condition that Transmission System shall be left in a safe and reliable
condition in accordance with Good Utility Practice and Transmission Provider's
safety and reliability criteria. In such event, Interconnection Customer shall be
responsible for all reasonable and necessary costs which Transmission Provider (i)
has incurred pursuant to this LGIA prior to the suspension and (ii) incurs in
suspending such work, including any costs incurred to perform such work as may
be necessary to ensure the safety of persons and property and the integrity of the
Transmission System during such suspension and, if applicable, any costs incurred
in connection with the cancellation or suspension of material, equipment and labor
contracts which Transmission Provider cannot reasonably avoid; provided,
however, that prior to canceling or suspending any such material, equipment or

Provider to recommence the work required under this LGIA on or before the
expiration of three (3) years following commencement of such suspension, this
LGIA shall be deemed terminated. The three-year period shall begin on the date
the suspension is requested, or the date of the written notice to Transmission
Provider, if no effective date is specified.
5.17

Taxes.
5.17.1

Interconnection Customer Payments Not Taxable. The Parties
intend that all payments or property transfers made by
Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for the
installation of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and
the Network Upgrades shall be non-taxable, either as contributions
to capital, or as an advance, in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Code and any applicable state income tax laws and shall not be
taxable as contributions in aid of construction or otherwise under the
Internal Revenue Code and any applicable state income tax laws.

5.17.2

Representations and Covenants. In accordance with IRS Notice
2001-82 and IRS Notice 88-129, Interconnection Customer
represents and covenants that (i) ownership of the electricity
generated at the Large Generating Facility will pass to another party
prior to the transmission of the electricity on the Transmission
System, (ii) for income tax purposes, the amount of any payments

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 204 -

and the cost of any property transferred to Transmission Provider for
Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities will be capitalized
by Interconnection Customer as an intangible asset and recovered
using the straight-line method over a useful life of twenty (20) years,
and (iii) any portion of Transmission Provider's Interconnection
Facilities that is a "dual-use intertie," within the meaning of IRS
Notice 88-129, is reasonably expected to carry only a de minimis
amount of electricity in the direction of the Large Generating
Facility. For this purpose, "de minimis amount" means no more than
5 percent of the total power flows in both directions, calculated in
accordance with the "5 percent test" set forth in IRS Notice 88-129.
This is not intended to be an exclusive list of the relevant conditions
that must be met to conform to IRS requirements for non-taxable
treatment.
At Transmission Provider's request, Interconnection Customer shall
provide Transmission Provider with a report from an independent
engineer confirming its representation in clause (iii), above.
Transmission Provider represents and covenants that the cost of
Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities paid for by
Interconnection Customer will have no net effect on the base upon
which rates are determined.
5.17.3

Indemnification for the Cost Consequences of Current Tax
Liability Imposed Upon the Transmission Provider.
Notwithstanding Article 5.17.1, Interconnection Customer shall
protect, indemnify and hold harmless Transmission Provider from
the cost consequences of any current tax liability imposed against
Transmission Provider as the result of payments or property transfers
made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under
this LGIA for Interconnection Facilities, as well as any interest and
penalties, other than interest and penalties attributable to any delay
caused by Transmission Provider.
Transmission Provider shall not include a gross-up for the cost
consequences of any current tax liability in the amounts it charges
Interconnection Customer under this LGIA unless (i) Transmission
Provider has determined, in good faith, that the payments or property
transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission
Provider should be reported as income subject to taxation or (ii) any
Governmental Authority directs Transmission Provider to report
payments or property as income subject to taxation; provided,
however, that Transmission Provider may require Interconnection

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 205 -

Customer to provide security for Interconnection Facilities, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Transmission Provider (such as a parental
guarantee or a letter of credit), in an amount equal to the cost
consequences of any current tax liability under this Article 5.17.
Interconnection Customer shall reimburse Transmission Provider for
such costs on a fully grossed-up basis, in accordance with Article
5.17.4, within thirty (30) Calendar Days of receiving written
notification from Transmission Provider of the amount due,
including detail about how the amount was calculated.
The indemnification obligation shall terminate at the earlier of (1)
the expiration of the ten year testing period and the applicable statute
of limitation, as it may be extended by Transmission Provider upon
request of the IRS, to keep these years open for audit or adjustment,
or (2) the occurrence of a subsequent taxable event and the payment
of any related indemnification obligations as contemplated by this
Article 5.17.
5.17.4

Tax Gross-Up Amount. Interconnection Customer's liability for
the cost consequences of any current tax liability under this Article
5.17 shall be calculated on a fully grossed-up basis. Except as may
otherwise be agreed to by the parties, this means that Interconnection
Customer will pay Transmission Provider, in addition to the amount
paid for the Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, an
amount equal to (1) the current taxes imposed on Transmission
Provider ("Current Taxes") on the excess of (a) the gross income
realized by Transmission Provider as a result of payments or
property transfers made by Interconnection Customer to
Transmission Provider under this LGIA (without regard to any
payments under this Article 5.17) (the "Gross Income Amount")
over (b) the present value of future tax deductions for depreciation
that will be available as a result of such payments or property
transfers (the "Present Value Depreciation Amount"), plus (2) an
additional amount sufficient to permit Transmission Provider to
receive and retain, after the payment of all Current Taxes, an amount
equal to the net amount described in clause (1).
For this purpose, (i) Current Taxes shall be computed based on
Transmission Provider's composite federal and state tax rates at the
time the payments or property transfers are received and
Transmission Provider will be treated as being subject to tax at the
highest marginal rates in effect at that time (the "Current Tax Rate"),
and (ii) the Present Value Depreciation Amount shall be computed

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 206 -

by discounting Transmission Provider's anticipated tax depreciation
deductions as a result of such payments or property transfers by
Transmission Provider's current weighted average cost of capital.
Thus, the formula for calculating Interconnection Customer's
liability to Transmission Owner pursuant to this Article 5.17.4 can
be expressed as follows: (Current Tax Rate x (Gross Income
Amount – Present Value of Tax Depreciation))/(1-Current Tax
Rate). Interconnection Customer's estimated tax liability in the
event taxes are imposed shall be stated in Appendix A,
Interconnection Facilities, Network Upgrades and Distribution
Upgrades.
5.17.5

Private Letter Ruling or Change or Clarification of Law. At
Interconnection Customer's request and expense, Transmission
Provider shall file with the IRS a request for a private letter ruling as
to whether any property transferred or sums paid, or to be paid, by
Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under this LGIA
are subject to federal income taxation. Interconnection Customer
will prepare the initial draft of the request for a private letter ruling,
and will certify under penalties of perjury that all facts represented in
such request are true and accurate to the best of Interconnection
Customer's knowledge. Transmission Provider and Interconnection
Customer shall cooperate in good faith with respect to the
submission of such request.
Transmission Provider shall keep Interconnection Customer fully
informed of the status of such request for a private letter ruling and
shall execute either a privacy act waiver or a limited power of
attorney, in a form acceptable to the IRS, that authorizes
Interconnection Customer to participate in all discussions with the
IRS regarding such request for a private letter ruling. Transmission
Provider shall allow Interconnection Customer to attend all meetings
with IRS officials about the request and shall permit Interconnection
Customer to prepare the initial drafts of any follow-up letters in
connection with the request.

5.17.6

Subsequent Taxable Events. If, within 10 years from the date on
which the relevant Transmission Provider's Interconnection
Facilities are placed in service, (i) Interconnection Customer
Breaches the covenants contained in Article 5.17.2, (ii) a
"disqualification event" occurs within the meaning of IRS Notice 88129, or (iii) this LGIA terminates and Transmission Provider retains
ownership of the Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades,

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 207 -

Interconnection Customer shall pay a tax gross-up for the cost
consequences of any current tax liability imposed on Transmission
Provider, calculated using the methodology described in Article
5.17.4 and in accordance with IRS Notice 90-60.
5.17.7

Contests. In the event any Governmental Authority determines that
Transmission Provider's receipt of payments or property constitutes
income that is subject to taxation, Transmission Provider shall notify
Interconnection Customer, in writing, within thirty (30) Calendar
Days of receiving notification of such determination by a
Governmental Authority. Upon the timely written request by
Interconnection Customer and at Interconnection Customer's sole
expense, Transmission Provider may appeal, protest, seek abatement
of, or otherwise oppose such determination. Upon Interconnection
Customer's written request and sole expense, Transmission Provider
may file a claim for refund with respect to any taxes paid under this
Article 5.17, whether or not it has received such a determination.
Transmission Provider reserves the right to make all decisions with
regard to the prosecution of such appeal, protest, abatement or other
contest, including the selection of counsel and compromise or
settlement of the claim, but Transmission Provider shall keep
Interconnection Customer informed, shall consider in good faith
suggestions from Interconnection Customer about the conduct of the
contest, and shall reasonably permit Interconnection Customer or an
Interconnection Customer representative to attend contest
proceedings.
Interconnection Customer shall pay to Transmission Provider on a
periodic basis, as invoiced by Transmission Provider, Transmission
Provider's documented reasonable costs of prosecuting such appeal,
protest, abatement or other contest. At any time during the contest,
Transmission Provider may agree to a settlement either with
Interconnection Customer's consent or after obtaining written advice
from nationally recognized tax counsel, selected by Transmission
Provider, but reasonably acceptable to Interconnection Customer,
that the proposed settlement represents a reasonable settlement given
the hazards of litigation. Interconnection Customer's obligation shall
be based on the amount of the settlement agreed to by
Interconnection Customer, or if a higher amount, so much of the
settlement that is supported by the written advice from nationally
recognized tax counsel selected under the terms of the preceding
sentence. The settlement amount shall be calculated on a fully
grossed-up basis to cover any related cost consequences of the

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 208 -

current tax liability. Any settlement without Interconnection
Customer's consent or such written advice will relieve
Interconnection Customer from any obligation to indemnify
Transmission Provider for the tax at issue in the contest.
5.17.8

Refund. In the event that (a) a private letter ruling is issued to
Transmission Provider which holds that any amount paid or the
value of any property transferred by Interconnection Customer to
Transmission Provider under the terms of this LGIA is not subject to
federal income taxation, (b) any legislative change or administrative
announcement, notice, ruling or other determination makes it
reasonably clear to Transmission Provider in good faith that any
amount paid or the value of any property transferred by
Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under the terms
of this LGIA is not taxable to Transmission Provider, (c) any
abatement, appeal, protest, or other contest results in a determination
that any payments or transfers made by Interconnection Customer to
Transmission Provider are not subject to federal income tax, or (d) if
Transmission Provider receives a refund from any taxing authority
for any overpayment of tax attributable to any payment or property
transfer made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission
Provider pursuant to this LGIA, Transmission Provider shall
promptly refund to Interconnection Customer the following:
(i) any payment made by Interconnection Customer under this
Article 5.17 for taxes that is attributable to the amount
determined to be non-taxable, together with interest thereon,
(ii) interest on any amounts paid by Interconnection Customer
to Transmission Provider for such taxes which Transmission
Provider did not submit to the taxing authority, calculated in
accordance with the methodology set forth in FERC's
regulations at 18 CFR § 35.19a(a)(2)(iii) from the date
payment was made by Interconnection Customer to the date
Transmission Provider refunds such payment to
Interconnection Customer, and
(iii) with respect to any such taxes paid by Transmission
Provider, any refund or credit Transmission Provider receives
or to which it may be entitled from any Governmental
Authority, interest (or that portion thereof attributable to the
payment described in clause (i), above) owed to Transmission
Provider for such overpayment of taxes (including any

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 209 reduction in interest otherwise payable by Transmission
Provider to any Governmental Authority resulting from an
offset or credit); provided, however, that Transmission
Provider will remit such amount promptly to Interconnection
Customer only after and to the extent that Transmission
Provider has received a tax refund, credit or offset from any
Governmental Authority for any applicable overpayment of
income tax related to Transmission Provider's Interconnection
Facilities.

The intent of this provision is to leave the Parties, to the extent
practicable, in the event that no taxes are due with respect to any
payment for Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades
hereunder, in the same position they would have been in had no such
tax payments been made.
5.17.9

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. Upon the timely request by
Interconnection Customer, and at Interconnection Customer's sole
expense, Transmission Provider may appeal, protest, seek abatement
of, or otherwise contest any tax (other than federal or state income
tax) asserted or assessed against Transmission Provider for which
Interconnection Customer may be required to reimburse
Transmission Provider under the terms of this LGIA.
Interconnection Customer shall pay to Transmission Provider on a
periodic basis, as invoiced by Transmission Provider, Transmission
Provider's documented reasonable costs of prosecuting such appeal,
protest, abatement, or other contest. Interconnection Customer and
Transmission Provider shall cooperate in good faith with respect to
any such contest. Unless the payment of such taxes is a prerequisite
to an appeal or abatement or cannot be deferred, no amount shall be
payable by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for
such taxes until they are assessed by a final, non-appealable order by
any court or agency of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a tax
payment is withheld and ultimately due and payable after appeal,
Interconnection Customer will be responsible for all taxes, interest
and penalties, other than penalties attributable to any delay caused
by Transmission Provider.

5.17.10

Transmission Owners Who Are Not Transmission Providers. If
Transmission Provider is not the same entity as the Transmission
Owner, then (i) all references in this Article 5.17 to Transmission
Provider shall be deemed also to refer to and to include the
Transmission Owner, as appropriate, and (ii) this LGIA shall not

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

become effective until such Transmission Owner shall have agreed
in writing to assume all of the duties and obligations of Transmission
Provider under this Article 5.17 of this LGIA.
5.18

Tax Status. Each Party shall cooperate with the other to maintain the other
Party's tax status. Nothing in this LGIA is intended to adversely affect any
Transmission Provider's tax exempt status with respect to the issuance of bonds
including, but not limited to, Local Furnishing Bonds.

5.19

Modification.
5.19.1 General. Either Party may undertake modifications to its facilities. If a
Party plans to undertake a modification that reasonably may be
expected to affect the other Party's facilities, that Party shall provide
to the other Party sufficient information regarding such modification
so that the other Party may evaluate the potential impact of such
modification prior to commencement of the work. Such information
shall be deemed to be confidential hereunder and shall include
information concerning the timing of such modifications and
whether such modifications are expected to interrupt the flow of
electricity from the Large Generating Facility. The Party desiring to
perform such work shall provide the relevant drawings, plans, and
specifications to the other Party at least ninety (90) Calendar Days in
advance of the commencement of the work or such shorter period
upon which the Parties may agree, which agreement shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.
In the case of Large Generating Facility modifications that do not

Interconnection Facilities in accordance with all applicable requirements of the
[Control Area]Balancing Authority Area of which it is part, as such requirements
are set forth in Appendix C, Interconnection Details, of this LGIA. Appendix C,
Interconnection Details, will be modified to reflect changes to the requirements as
they may change from time to time. Either Party may request that the other Party
provide copies of the requirements set forth in Appendix C, Interconnection
Details, of this LGIA.
9.5

Start-Up and Synchronization. Consistent with the Parties' mutually acceptable
procedures, Interconnection Customer is responsible for the proper
synchronization of the Large Generating Facility to Transmission Provider's
Transmission System.

9.6

Reactive Power and Primary Frequency Response.
9.6.1 Power Factor Design Criteria.
9.6.1.1

Synchronous Generation. Interconnection Customer shall
design the Large Generating Facility to maintain a composite
power delivery at continuous rated power output at the Point
of Interconnection at a power factor within the range of 0.95
leading to 0.95 lagging, unless [the]Transmission Provider
has established different requirements that apply to all
synchronous generators in the [Control Area]Balancing
Authority Area on a comparable basis.

9.6.1.2

Non-Synchronous Generation. Interconnection Customer
shall design the Large Generating Facility to maintain a
composite power delivery at continuous rated power output at
the high-side of the generator substation at a power factor
within the range of 0.95 leading to 0.95 lagging, unless[the]
Transmission Provider has established a different power
factor range that applies to all non-synchronous generators in
the [Control Area]Balancing Authority Area on a comparable
basis. This power factor range standard shall be dynamic and
can be met using, for example, power electronics designed to
supply this level of reactive capability (taking into account
any limitations due to voltage level, real power output, etc.)
or fixed and switched capacitors, or a combination of the two.
This requirement shall only apply to newly interconnecting
non-synchronous generators that have not yet executed a
Facilities Study Agreement as of the effective date of the
Final Rule establishing this requirement (Order No. 827).

9.6.2 Voltage Schedules. Once Interconnection Customer has synchronized the
Large Generating Facility with the Transmission System, Transmission
Provider shall require Interconnection Customer to operate the
LargeGenerating Facility to produce or absorb reactive power within the
design limitations of the Large Generating Facility set forth in Article 9.6.1
(Power Factor Design Criteria). Transmission Provider’s voltage schedules
shall treat all sources of reactive power in the [Control Area]Balancing
Authority Area in an equitable and not unduly discriminatory manner.
Transmission Provider shall exercise Reasonable Efforts to provide
Interconnection Customer with such schedules at least one (1) day in
advance, and may make changes to such schedules as necessary to maintain
the reliability of the Transmission System. Interconnection Customer shall
operate the Large Generating Facility to maintain the specified output
voltage or power factor at the Point of Interconnection within the design
limitations of the Large Generating Facility set forth in Article 9.6.1 (Power
Factor Design Criteria). If Interconnection Customer is unable to maintain
the specified voltage or power factor, it shall promptly notify the System
Operator.
9.6.2.1

Voltage Regulators. Whenever the Large Generating Facility
is operated in parallel with the Transmission System and
voltage regulators are capable of operation, Interconnection
Customer shall operate the Large Generating Facility with its
voltage regulators in automatic operation. If the Large
Generating Facility's voltage regulators are not capable of
such automatic operation, Interconnection Customer shall
immediately notify Transmission Provider’s system operator,
or its designated representative, and ensure that such Large
Generating Facility’s reactive power production or absorption
(measured in MVARs) are within the design capability of the
Large Generating Facility’s generating unit(s) and steady
state stability limits. Interconnection Customer shall not cause
its Large Generating Facility to disconnect automatically or
instantaneously from the Transmission System or trip any
generating unit comprising the Large Generating Facility for
an under or over frequency condition unless the abnormal
frequency condition persists for a time period beyond the
limits set forth in ANSI/IEEE Standard C37.106, or such
other standard as applied to other generators in the [Control
Area]Balancing Authority Area on a comparable basis.

9.6.3 Payment for Reactive Power. Transmission Provider is required to pay
Interconnection Customer for reactive power that Interconnection Customer

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 218 -

provides or absorbs from the Large Generating Facility when Transmission
Provider requests Interconnection Customer to operate its Large Generating
Facility outside the range specified in Article 9.6.1, provided that if
Transmission Provider pays its own or affiliated generators for reactive
power service within the specified range, it must also pay Interconnection
Customer. Payments shall be pursuant to Article 11.6 or such other
agreement to which the Parties have otherwise agreed.
9.6.4 Primary Frequency Response. Interconnection Customer shall
ensure the primary frequency response capability of its Large Generating
Facility by installing, maintaining, and operating a functioning governor or
equivalent controls. The term “functioning governor or equivalent
controls” as used herein shall mean the required hardware and/or software
that provides frequency responsive real power control with the ability to
sense changes in system frequency and autonomously adjust the Large
Generating Facility’s real power output in accordance with the droop and
deadband parameters and in the direction needed to correct frequency
deviations. Interconnection Customer is required to install a governor or
equivalent controls with the capability of operating: (1) with a maximum 5
percent droop and ±0.036 Hz deadband; or (2) in accordance with the
relevant droop, deadband, and timely and sustained response settings from
an approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for equivalent or more stringent parameters. The
droop characteristic shall be: (1) based on the nameplate capacity of the
Large Generating Facility, and shall be linear in the range of frequencies
between 59 to 61 Hz that are outside of the deadband parameter; or (2)
based an approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for an equivalent or more stringent parameter. The
deadband parameter shall be: the range of frequencies above and below
nominal (60 Hz) in which the governor or equivalent controls is not
expected to adjust the Large Generating Facility’s real power output in
response to frequency deviations. The deadband shall be implemented: (1)
without a step to the droop curve, that is, once the frequency deviation
exceeds the deadband parameter, the expected change in the Large
Generating Facility’s real power output in response to frequency deviations
shall start from zero and then increase (for under-frequency deviations) or
decrease (for over-frequency deviations) linearly in proportion to the
magnitude of the frequency deviation; or (2) in accordance with an
approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for an equivalent or more stringent parameter.
Interconnection Customer shall notify Transmission Provider that the
primary frequency response capability of the Large Generating Facility has
been tested and confirmed during commissioning. Once Interconnection

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 219 -

Customer has synchronized the Large Generating Facility with the
Transmission System, Interconnection Customer shall operate the Large
Generating Facility consistent with the provisions specified in Sections
9.6.4.1 and 9.6.4.2 of this Agreement. The primary frequency response
requirements contained herein shall apply to both synchronous and nonsynchronous Large Generating Facilities.
9.6.4.1

Governor or Equivalent Controls. Whenever the Large
Generating Facility is operated in parallel with the
Transmission System, Interconnection Customer shall operate
the Large Generating Facility with its governor or equivalent
controls in service and responsive to frequency.
Interconnection Customer shall: (1) in coordination with
Transmission Provider and/or the relevant balancing
authority, set the deadband parameter to: (1) a
maximum of ±0.036 Hz and set the droop parameter to a
maximum of 5 percent; or (2) implement the relevant droop
and deadband settings from an approved [NERC] Electric
Reliability Organization [R]reliability [S]standard that
provides for equivalent or more stringent parameters.
Interconnection Customer shall be required to provide the
status and settings of the governor or equivalent controls to
Transmission Provider and/or the relevant balancing authority
upon request. If Interconnection
Customer needs to operate the Large Generating Facility with
its governor or equivalent controls not in service,
Interconnection Customer shall immediately notify
Transmission Provider and the relevant balancing authority,
and provide both with the following information: (1) the
operating status of the governor or equivalent controls (i.e.,
whether it is currently out of service or when it will be taken
out of service); (2) the reasons for removing the governor or
equivalent controls from service; and (3) a reasonable
estimate of when the governor or equivalent controls will be
returned to service. Interconnection Customer shall make
Reasonable Efforts to return its governor or equivalent
controls into service as soon as practicable. Interconnection
Customer shall make Reasonable Efforts to keep outages of
the Large Generating Facility’s governor or equivalent
controls to a minimum whenever the Large Generating
Facility is operated in parallel with the Transmission System.

9.6.4.2

Timely and Sustained Response. Interconnection Customer
shall ensure that the Large Generating Facility’s real power
response to sustained frequency deviations outside of the
deadband setting is automatically provided and shall begin
immediately after frequency deviates outside of the deadband,
and to the extent the Large Generating Facility has operating
capability in the direction needed to correct the frequency
deviation. Interconnection Customer shall not block or
otherwise inhibit the ability of the governor or equivalent
controls to respond and shall ensure that the response is not
inhibited, except under certain operational constraints
including, but not limited to, ambient temperature limitations,
physical energy limitations, outages of mechanical
equipment, or regulatory requirements. The Large
Generating Facility shall sustain the real power response at
least until system frequency returns to a value within the
deadband setting of the governor or equivalent controls. A
Commission-approved [R]reliability [S]standard with
equivalent or more stringent requirements shall supersede the
above requirements.

9.6.4.3

Exemptions. Large Generating Facilities that are regulated
by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall be
exempt from Sections 9.6.4, 9.6.4.1, and 9.6.4.2 of this
Agreement. Large Generating Facilities that are behind the
meter generation that is sized-to-load (i.e., the thermal load
and the generation are near-balanced in real-time operation
and the generation is primarily controlled to maintain the
unique thermal, chemical, or mechanical output necessary for
the operating requirements of its host facility) shall be
required to install primary frequency response capability in
accordance with the droop and deadband capability
requirements specified in Section 9.6.4, but shall be otherwise
exempt from the operating requirements in Sections 9.6.4,
9.6.4.1, 9.6.4.2, and 9.6.4.4 of this Agreement.

9.6.4.4.

Electric Storage Resources. Interconnection Customer
interconnecting a Generating Facility that contains an
electric storage resource shall establish an operating range in
Appendix C of its LGIA that specifies a minimum state of
charge and a maximum state of charge between which the
electric storage resource will be required to provide primary
frequency response consistent with the conditions set forth in

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 221 Sections 9.6.4, 9.6.4.1, 9.6.4.2 and 9.6.4.3 of this Agreement.
Appendix C shall specify whether the operating range is static
or dynamic, and shall consider (1) the expected magnitude of
frequency deviations in the interconnection; (2) the expected
duration that system frequency will remain outside of the
deadband parameter in the interconnection; (3) the expected
incidence of frequency deviations outside of the deadband
parameter in the interconnection; (4) the physical capabilities
of the electric storage resource; (5) operational limitations of
the electric storage resource due to manufacturer
specifications; and (6) any other relevant factors agreed to by
Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer, and in
consultation with the relevant transmission owner or
balancing authority as appropriate. If the operating range is
dynamic, then Appendix C must establish how frequently the
operating range will be reevaluated and the factors that may
be considered during its reevaluation.
Interconnection Customer’s electric storage resource is
required to provide timely and sustained primary frequency
response consistent with Section 9.6.4.2 of this Agreement
when it is online and dispatched to inject electricity to the
Transmission System and/or receive electricity from the
Transmission System. This excludes circumstances when the
electric storage resource is not dispatched to inject electricity
to the Transmission System and/or dispatched to receive
electricity from the Transmission System. If Interconnection
Customer’s electric storage resource is charging at the time of
a frequency deviation outside of its deadband parameter, it is
to increase (for over-frequency deviations) or decrease (for
under-frequency deviations) the rate at which it is charging in
accordance with its droop parameter. Interconnection
Customer’s electric storage resource is not required to change
from charging to discharging, or vice versa, unless the
response necessitated by the droop and deadband settings
requires it to do so and it is technically capable of making
such a transition.

shall compensate Interconnection Customer in accordance with Interconnection
Customer's applicable rate schedule then in effect unless the provision of such
service(s) is subject to an RTO or ISO FERC-approved rate schedule.
Interconnection Customer shall serve Transmission Provider or RTO or ISO with
any filing of a proposed rate schedule at the time of such filing with FERC. To the
extent that no rate schedule is in effect at the time the Interconnection Customer is
required to provide or absorb any Reactive Power under this LGIA, Transmission
Provider agrees to compensate Interconnection Customer in such amount as would
have been due Interconnection Customer had the rate schedule been in effect at the
time service commenced; provided, however, that such rate schedule must be filed
at FERC or other appropriate Governmental Authority within sixty (60) Calendar
Days of the commencement of service.

actions relating to injury to or death of any person or damage to property, demand,
suits, recoveries, costs and expenses, court costs, attorney fees, and all other
obligations by or to third parties, arising out of or resulting from the other Party's
action or inactions of its obligations under this LGIA on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing
by the indemnified Party.
18.1.1

Indemnified Person. If an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification under this Article 18 as a result of a claim by a third
party, and the Indemnifying Party fails, after notice and reasonable
opportunity to proceed under Article 18.1, to assume the defense of

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

such claim, such Indemnified Person may at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party contest, settle or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, or pay in full, such claim.
18.1.2

Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party is obligated to
indemnify and hold any Indemnified Person harmless under this
Article 18, the amount owing to the Indemnified Person shall be the
amount of such Indemnified Person's actual Loss, net of any
insurance or other recovery.

18.1.3

Indemnity Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
Person of any claim or notice of the commencement of any action or

indemnity provided for in Article 18.1 may apply, the Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such fact. Any failure
of or delay in such notification shall not affect a Party's
indemnification obligation unless such failure or delay is materially
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof with counsel designated by such Indemnifying Party and

in any such action include one or more Indemnified Persons and the
Indemnifying Party and if the Indemnified Person reasonably
concludes that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or
other Indemnified Persons which are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal
defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
its own behalf. In such instances, the Indemnifying Party shall only
be required to pay the fees and expenses of one additional attorney
to represent an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons having
such differing or additional legal defenses.
The Indemnified Person shall be entitled, at its expense, to
participate in any such action, suit or proceeding, the defense of
which has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party (i) shall not
be entitled to assume and control the defense of any such action, suit
or proceedings if and to the extent that, in the opinion of the
Indemnified Person and its counsel, such action, suit or proceeding
involves the potential imposition of criminal liability on the
Indemnified Person, or there exists a conflict or adversity of interest

consent of the Indemnified Person, which shall not be reasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The disclosure by each Party to the other Party of Confidential
Information shall not be deemed a waiver by either Party or any
other person or entity of the right to protect the Confidential
Information from public disclosure.

22.1.5

No Warranties. By providing Confidential Information, neither
Party makes any warranties or representations as to its accuracy or
completeness. In addition, by supplying Confidential Information,
neither Party obligates itself to provide any particular information or
Confidential Information to the other Party nor to enter into any

protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized
disclosure, publication or dissemination. Each Party may use
Confidential Information solely to fulfill its obligations to the other
Party under this LGIA or its regulatory requirements.

22.1.7

Order of Disclosure. If a court or a Government Authority or entity
with the right, power, and apparent authority to do so requests or
requires either Party, by subpoena, oral deposition, interrogatories,
requests for production of documents, administrative order, or

other Party, without retaining copies thereof, any and all written or
electronic Confidential Information received from the other Party.
22.1.9

Remedies. The Parties agree that monetary damages would be
inadequate to compensate a Party for the other Party's Breach of its
obligations under this Article 22. Each Party accordingly agrees that
the other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, by way of
injunction or otherwise, if the first Party Breaches or threatens to
Breach its obligations under this Article 22, which equitable relief
shall be granted without bond or proof of damages, and the receiving
Party shall not plead in defense that there would be an adequate
remedy at law. Such remedy shall not be deemed an exclusive
remedy for the Breach of this Article 22, but shall be in addition to
all other remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that the covenants contained herein are
necessary for the protection of legitimate business interests and are
reasonable in scope. No Party, however, shall be liable for indirect,
incidental, or consequential or punitive damages of any nature or
kind resulting from or arising in connection with this Article 22.

22.1.10

Disclosure to FERC, its Staff, or a State. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 22 to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR
section 1b.20, if FERC or its staff, during the course of an
investigation or otherwise, requests information from one of the
Parties that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence
pursuant to this LGIA, the Party shall provide the requested
information to FERC or its staff, within the time provided for in the
request for information. In providing the information to FERC or its

request that the information be treated as confidential and non-public
by FERC and its staff and that the information be withheld from
public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the other
Party to this LGIA prior to the release of the Confidential
Information to FERC or its staff. The Party shall notify the other
Party to the LGIA when it is notified by FERC or its staff that a
request to release Confidential Information has been received by
FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such
information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR section
388.112. Requests from a state regulatory body conducting a
confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar manner if
consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.

INTERCONNECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR A WIND GENERATING PLANT
Appendix G sets forth requirements and provisions specific to a wind generating
plant or a Generating Facility that contains a wind generating plant. All other
requirements of this LGIA continue to apply to wind generating plant interconnections.
A.

Technical Standards Applicable to a Wind Generating Plant
i.

Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) Capability

A wind generating plant shall be able to remain online during voltage disturbances
up to the time periods and associated voltage levels set forth in the standard below. The
LVRT standard provides for a transition period standard and a post-transition period
standard.
Transition Period LVRT Standard
The transition period standard applies to wind generating plants subject to FERC
Order 661 that have either: (i) interconnection agreements signed and filed with the
Commission, filed with the Commission in unexecuted form, or filed with the
Commission as non-conforming agreements between January 1, 2006 and December 31,
2006, with a scheduled in-service date no later than December 31, 2007, or (ii) wind
generating turbines subject to a wind turbine procurement contract executed prior to
December 31, 2005, for delivery through 2007.
1.

Wind generating plants are required to remain in-service during three-phase faults
with normal clearing (which is a time period of approximately 4 – 9 cycles) and

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 264 -

single line to ground faults with delayed clearing, and subsequent post-fault
voltage recovery to prefault voltage unless clearing the fault effectively
disconnects the generator from the system. The clearing time requirement for a
three-phase fault will be specific to the wind generating plant substation location,
as determined by and documented by the transmission provider. The maximum
clearing time the wind generating plant shall be required to withstand for a threephase fault shall be 9 cycles at a voltage as low as 0.15 p.u., as measured at the
high side of the wind generating plant step-up transformer(i.e. the transformer that
steps the voltage up to the transmission interconnection voltage or “GSU”), after
which, if the fault remains following the location-specific normal clearing time for
three-phase faults, the wind generating plant may disconnect from the
transmission system.
2.

This requirement does not apply to faults that would occur between the wind
generator terminals and the high side of the GSU or to faults that would result in a
voltage lower than 0.15 per unit on the high side of the GSU serving the facility.

3.

Wind generating plants may be tripped after the fault period if this action is
intended as part of a special protection system.

4.

Wind generating plants may meet the LVRT requirements of this standard by the
performance of the generators or by installing additional equipment (e.g., Static
VAr Compensator, etc.) within the wind generating plant or by a combination of
generator performance and additional equipment.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000
5.

- 265 -

Existing individual generator units that are, or have been, interconnected to the
network at the same location at the effective date of the Appendix G LVRT
Standard are exempt from meeting the Appendix G LVRT Standard for the
remaining life of the existing generation equipment. Existing individual generator
units that are replaced are required to meet the Appendix G LVRT Standard.

Post-transition Period LVRT Standard
All wind generating plants subject to FERC Order No. 661 and not covered by the
transition period described above must meet the following requirements:
1.

Wind generating plants are required to remain in-service during three-phase faults
with normal clearing (which is a time period of approximately 4 – 9 cycles) and
single line to ground faults with delayed clearing, and subsequent post-fault
voltage recovery to prefault voltage unless clearing the fault effectively
disconnects the generator from the system. The clearing time requirement for a
three-phase fault will be specific to the wind generating plant substation location,
as determined by and documented by the transmission provider. The maximum
clearing time the wind generating plant shall be required to withstand for a threephase fault shall be 9 cycles after which, if the fault remains following the
location-specific normal clearing time for three-phase faults, the wind generating
plant may disconnect from the transmission system. A wind generating plant shall
remain interconnected during such a fault on the transmission system for a voltage
level as low as zero volts, as measured at the high voltage side of the wind GSU.

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000
2.

- 266 -

This requirement does not apply to faults that would occur between the wind
generator terminals and the high side of the GSU.

3.

Wind generating plants may be tripped after the fault period if this action is
intended as part of a special protection system.

4.

Wind generating plants may meet the LVRT requirements of this standard by the
performance of the generators or by installing additional equipment (e.g., Static
VAr Compensator) within the wind generating plant or by a combination of
generator performance and additional equipment.

Existing individual generator units that are, or have been, interconnected to the network
at the same location at the effective date of the Appendix G LVRT Standard are exempt
from meeting the Appendix G LVRT Standard for the remaining life of the existing
generation equipment. Existing individual generator units that are replaced are required to
meet the Appendix G LVRT Standard.
ii.

Power Factor Design Criteria (Reactive Power)

The following reactive power requirements apply only to a newly interconnecting
wind generating plant that has executed a Facilities Study Agreement as of the effective
date of the Final Rule establishing the reactive power requirements for non-synchronous
generators in S[s]ection 9.6.1 of this LGIA (Order No. 827). A wind generating plant to
which this provision applies shall maintain a power factor within the range of 0.95
leading to 0.95 lagging, measured at the Point of Interconnection as defined in this LGIA,
if the Transmission Provider’s [System Impact] Cluster Study shows that such a
requirement is necessary to ensure safety or reliability. The power factor range standard

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Docket No. RM22-14-000

- 267 -

can be met by using, for example, power electronics designed to supply this level of
reactive capability 606 (taking into account any limitations due to voltage level, real
power output, etc.) or fixed and switched capacitors if agreed to by the Transmission
Provider, or a combination of the two. The Interconnection Customer shall not disable
power factor equipment while the wind plant is in operation. Wind plants shall also be
able to provide sufficient dynamic voltage support in lieu of the power system stabilizer
and automatic voltage regulation at the generator excitation system if the System Impact
Study shows this to be required for system safety or reliability.
iii.

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Capability

The wind plant shall provide SCADA capability to transmit data and receive
instructions from the Transmission Provider to protect system reliability. The
Transmission Provider and the wind plant Interconnection Customer shall determine what
SCADA information is essential for the proposed wind plant, taking into account the size
of the plant and its characteristics, location, and importance in maintaining generation
resource adequacy and transmission system reliability in its area.

Attachment 2
SMALL GENERATOR INTERCONNECTION REQUEST
(Application Form)
***
Models for Non-synchronous Small Generating Facilities
For a non-synchronous Small Generating Facility, Interconnection Customer shall
provide (1) a validated user-defined root mean squared (RMS) positive sequence
dynamics model; (2) an appropriately parameterized generic library RMS positive
sequence dynamics model, including model block diagram of the inverter control and
plant control systems, as defined by the selection in Table 1 or a model otherwise
approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, that corresponds to
Interconnection Customer’s Small Generating Facility; and (3) if applicable, a validated
electromagnetic transient model if Transmission Provider performs an electromagnetic
transient study as part of the interconnection study process. A user-defined model is a set
of programming code created by equipment manufacturers or developers that captures
the latest features of controllers that are mainly software based and represents the
entities’ control strategies but does not necessarily correspond to any generic library
model. Interconnection Customer must also demonstrate that the model is validated by
providing evidence that the equipment behavior is consistent with the model behavior
(e.g., an attestation from Interconnection Customer that the model accurately represents
the entire Small Generating Facility; attestations from each equipment manufacturer that
the user defined model accurately represents the component of the Small Generating
Facility; or test data).

conditions, in accordance with Good Utility Practice and consistent with
any standards and guidelines that are applied to other generating facilities
in the Balancing Authority Area on a comparable basis. The term
“frequency ride through” as used herein shall mean the ability of a Small
Generating Facility to stay connected to and synchronized with the system
or equipment of the Transmission Provider and any Affected Systems
during system disturbances within a range of under-frequency and overfrequency conditions, in accordance with Good Utility Practice and
consistent with any standards and guidelines that are applied to other
generating facilities in the Balancing Authority Area on a comparable basis.
The term “voltage ride through” as used herein shall mean the ability of a
Small Generating Facility to stay connected to and synchronized with the

system or equipment of the Transmission Provider and any Affected
Systems during system disturbances within a range of under-voltage and
over-voltage conditions, in accordance with Good Utility Practice and
consistent with any standards and guidelines that are applied to other
generating facilities in the Balancing Authority Area on a comparable basis.
For abnormal frequency conditions and voltage conditions within the “no
trip zone” defined by Reliability Standard PRC-024-3 or successor
mandatory ride through Applicable Reliability Standards, the nonsynchronous Small Generating Facility must ensure that, within any
physical limitations of the Small Generating Facility, its control and
protection settings are configured or set to (1) continue active power
production during disturbance and post disturbance periods at predisturbance levels unless providing primary frequency response or fast
frequency response; (2) minimize reductions in active power and remain
within dynamic voltage and current limits, if reactive power priority mode
is enabled, unless providing primary frequency response or fast frequency
response; (3) not artificially limit dynamic reactive power capability during
disturbances; and (4) return to pre-disturbance active power levels without
artificial ramp rate limits if active power is reduced, unless providing
primary frequency response or fast frequency response.
1.6

Parallel Operation Obligations. Once the Small Generating Facility has been
authorized to commence parallel operation, the Interconnection Customer shall
abide by all rules and procedures pertaining to the parallel operation of the Small
Generating Facility in the applicable [control area]Balancing Authority Area,
including, but not limited to; 1) the rules and procedures concerning the operation
of generation set forth in the Tariff or by the applicable system operator(s) for the
Transmission Provider's Transmission System and; 2) the Operating Requirements
set forth in Attachment 5 of this Agreement.

Reactive Power and Primary Frequency Response
1.8.1 Power Factor Design Criteria
1.8.1.1 Synchronous Generation. The Interconnection Customer shall
design its Small Generating Facility to maintain a composite power
delivery at continuous rated power output at the Point of
Interconnection at a power factor within the range of 0.95 leading
to 0.95 lagging, unless the Transmission Provider has established
different requirements that apply to all similarly situated

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

- 278 -

synchronous generators in the [control area]Balancing Authority
Area on a comparable basis.
1.8.1.2 Non-Synchronous Generation. The Interconnection Customer
shall design its Small Generating Facility to maintain a composite
power delivery at continuous rated power output at the high-side of
the generator substation at a power factor within the range of 0.95
leading to 0.95 lagging, unless the Transmission Provider has
established a different power factor range that applies to all
similarly situated non-synchronous generators in the [control
area]Balancing Authority Area on a comparable basis. This power
factor range standard shall be dynamic and can be met using, for
example, power electronics designed to supply this level of
reactive capability (taking into account any limitations due to
voltage level, real power output, etc.) or fixed and switched
capacitors, or a combination of the two. This requirement shall
only apply to newly interconnecting non-synchronous generators
that have not yet executed a Facilities Study Agreement as of the
effective date of the Final Rule establishing this requirement
(Order No. 827).
1.8.2 The Transmission Provider is required to pay the Interconnection Customer
for reactive power that the Interconnection Customer provides or absorbs
from the Small Generating Facility when the Transmission Provider
requests the Interconnection Customer to operate its Small Generating
Facility outside the range specified in A[a]rticle 1.8.1. In addition, if the
Transmission Provider pays its own or affiliated generators for reactive
power service within the specified range, it must also pay the
Interconnection Customer.
1.8.3 Payments shall be in accordance with the Interconnection Customer's
applicable rate schedule then in effect unless the provision of such
service(s) is subject to a regional transmission organization or independent
system operator FERC-approved rate schedule. To the extent that no rate
schedule is in effect at the time the Interconnection Customer is required to
provide or absorb reactive power under this Agreement, the Parties agree to
expeditiously file such rate schedule and agree to support any request for
waiver of the Commission's prior notice requirement in order to
compensate the Interconnection Customer from the time service
commenced.
1.8.4 Primary Frequency Response. Interconnection Customer shall ensure the
primary frequency response capability of its Small Generating Facility by

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

installing, maintaining, and operating a functioning governor or equivalent
controls. The term “functioning governor or equivalent controls” as used
herein shall mean the required hardware and/or software that provides
frequency responsive real power control with the ability to sense changes in
system frequency and autonomously adjust the Small Generating Facility’s
real power output in accordance with the droop and deadband parameters
and in the direction needed to correct frequency deviations.
Interconnection Customer is required to install a governor or equivalent
controls with the capability of operating: (1) with a maximum 5 percent
droop and ±0.036 Hz deadband; or (2) in accordance with the relevant
droop, deadband, and timely and sustained response settings from an
approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for equivalent or more stringent parameters. The
droop characteristic shall be: (1) based on the nameplate capacity of the
Small Generating Facility, and shall be linear in the range of frequencies
between 59 to 61 Hz that are outside of the deadband parameter; or (2)
based an approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for an equivalent or more stringent parameter. The
deadband parameter shall be: the range of frequencies above and below
nominal (60 Hz) in which the governor or equivalent controls is not
expected to adjust the Small Generating Facility’s real power output in
response to frequency deviations. The deadband shall be implemented: (1)
without a step to the droop curve, that is, once the frequency deviation
exceeds the deadband parameter, the expected change in the Small
Generating Facility’s real power output in response to frequency deviations
shall start from zero and then increase (for under-frequency deviations) or
decrease (for over-frequency deviations) linearly in proportion to the
magnitude of the frequency deviation; or (2) in accordance with an
approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization [R]reliability
[S]standard providing for an equivalent or more stringent parameter.
Interconnection Customer shall notify Transmission Provider that the
primary frequency response capability of the Small Generating Facility has
been tested and confirmed during commissioning. Once Interconnection
Customer has synchronized the Small Generating Facility with the
Transmission System, Interconnection Customer shall operate the Small
Generating Facility consistent with the provisions specified in Sections
1.8.4.1 and 1.8.4.2 of this Agreement. The primary frequency response
requirements contained herein shall apply to both synchronous and nonsynchronous Small Generating Facilities.
1.8.4.1 Governor or Equivalent Controls. Whenever the Small Generating
Facility is operated in parallel with the Transmission System,
Interconnection Customer shall operate the Small Generating

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

Docket No. RM22-14-000

Filed Date: 07/28/2023

Facility with its governor or equivalent controls in service and
responsive to frequency. Interconnection Customer shall: (1) in
coordination with Transmission Provider and/or the relevant
[b]Balancing [a]Authority, set the deadband parameter to: (1) a
maximum of ±0.036 Hz and set the droop parameter to a maximum
of 5 percent; or (2) implement the relevant droop and deadband
settings from an approved [NERC] Electric Reliability Organization
[R]reliability [S]standard that provides for equivalent or more
stringent parameters. Interconnection Customer shall be required to
provide the status and settings of the governor or equivalent controls
to Transmission Provider and/or the relevant [b]Balancing
[a]Authority upon request. If Interconnection Customer needs to
operate the Small Generating Facility with its governor or equivalent
controls not in service, Interconnection Customer shall immediately
notify Transmission Provider and the relevant [b]Balancing
[a]Authority, and provide both with the following information: (1)
the operating status of the governor or equivalent controls (i.e.,
whether it is currently out of service or when it will be taken out of
service); (2) the reasons for removing the governor or equivalent
controls from service; and (3) a reasonable estimate of when the
governor or equivalent controls will be returned to service.
Interconnection Customer shall make Reasonable Efforts to return
its governor or equivalent controls into service as soon as
practicable. Interconnection Customer shall make Reasonable
Efforts to keep outages of the Small Generating Facility’s governor
or equivalent controls to a minimum whenever the Small Generating
Facility is operated in parallel with the Transmission System.
1.8.4.2 Timely and Sustained Response. Interconnection Customer shall
ensure that the Small Generating Facility’s real power response to
sustained frequency deviations outside of the deadband setting is
automatically provided and shall begin immediately after frequency
deviates outside of the deadband, and to the extent the Small
Generating Facility has operating capability in the direction needed
to correct the frequency deviation. Interconnection Customer shall
not block or otherwise inhibit the ability of the governor or
equivalent controls to respond and shall ensure that the response is
not inhibited, except under certain operational constraints including,
but not limited to, ambient temperature limitations, physical energy
limitations, outages of mechanical equipment, or regulatory
requirements. The Small Generating Facility shall sustain the real
power response at least until system frequency returns to a value
within the deadband setting of the governor or equivalent controls.

A Commission-approved Reliability Standard with equivalent or
more stringent requirements shall supersede the above requirements.
1.8.4.3 Exemptions. Small Generating Facilities that are regulated by the
United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall be exempt from
Sections 1.8.4, 1.8.4.1, and 1.8.4.2 of this Agreement. Small
Generating Facilities that are behind the meter generation that is
sized-to-load (i.e., the thermal load and the generation are nearbalanced in real-time operation and the generation is primarily
controlled to maintain the unique thermal, chemical, or mechanical
output necessary for the operating requirements of its host facility)
shall be required to install primary frequency response capability in
accordance with the droop and deadband capability requirements
specified in Section 1.8.4, but shall be otherwise exempt from the
operating requirements in Sections 1.8.4, 1.8.4.1, 1.8.4.2, and 1.8.4.4
of this Agreement.
1.8.4.4 Electric Storage Resources. Interconnection Customer
interconnecting an electric storage resource shall establish an
operating range in Attachment 5 of its SGIA that specifies a
minimum state of charge and a maximum state of charge between
which the electric storage resource will be required to provide
primary frequency response consistent with the conditions set forth
in Sections 1.8.4, 1.8.4.1, 1.8.4.2 and 1.8.4.3 of this Agreement.
Attachment 5 shall specify whether the operating range is static or
dynamic, and shall consider: (1) the expected magnitude of
frequency deviations in the interconnection; (2) the expected
duration that system frequency will remain outside of the deadband
parameter in the interconnection; (3) the expected incidence of
frequency deviations outside of the deadband parameter in the
interconnection; (4) the physical capabilities of the electric storage
resource; (5) operational limitations of the electric storage resource
due to manufacturer specifications; and (6) any other relevant factors
agreed to by Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer,
and in consultation with the relevant transmission owner or
[b]Balancing [a]Authority as appropriate. If the operating range is
dynamic, then Attachment 5 must establish how frequently the
operating range will be reevaluated and the factors that may be
considered during its reevaluation.
Interconnection Customer’s electric storage resource is required to
provide timely and sustained primary frequency response consistent
with Section 1.8.4.2 of this Agreement when it is online and

dispatched to inject electricity to the Transmission System and/or
receive electricity from the Transmission System. This excludes
circumstances when the electric storage resource is not dispatched to
inject electricity to the Transmission System and/or dispatched to
receive electricity from the Transmission System. If Interconnection
Customer’s electric storage resource is charging at the time of a
frequency deviation outside of its deadband parameter, it is to
increase (for over-frequency deviations) or decrease (for underfrequency deviations) the rate at which it is charging in accordance
with its droop parameter. Interconnection Customer’s electric
storage resource is not required to change from charging to
discharging, or vice versa, unless the response necessitated by the
droop and deadband settings requires it to do so and it is technically
capable of making such a transition.

(Issued July 28, 2023)
DANLY, Commissioner, concurring:
I concur in the issuance of today’s final rule. I write separately to state that, while
I continue to harbor misgivings about the Commission’s power to implement farreaching, uniform policies based on our authority under FPA section 206,1 I am satisfied
on this record that existing interconnection procedures in both RTO and non-RTO
regions have been shown to be unjust and unreasonable, and that we take today’s action
consistent with the standards articulated in precedent.2 Though I am not convinced that
this precedent will ultimately be proven correct in declaring that “the Commission may
rely on ‘generic’ or ‘general’ findings of a systemic problem to support imposition of an
industry-wide solution,” the Commission is entitled to act under prevailing case law.3
I also agree that the relatively narrow reforms contemplated in this final rule
appear, based on this record, to be a just and reasonable replacement rate. I am pleased
that most of that which I considered to be the most problematic elements in the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking have been excluded from this rule.4 I also remind parties of the
availability of “the independent entity variation standard for regional transmission
organizations (RTO) and independent system operators (ISO) and the consistent with or

seek variations from these rules.5
While I vote to approve today’s order, I will also thoroughly review any requests
for rehearing, particularly to the extent to which parties to the proceeding wish to
advance arguments that we have exceeded our authority under FPA section 206, or that
we have failed to carry our evidentiary burden, either generally, or in a sufficient number
of specific cases that our order amounts to an unlawful exercise of our powers.
I would have preferred to receive section 2056 filings from utilities proposing
interconnection reforms—and indeed we have received and ruled upon a number of such
filings. Failing that, I would have preferred for the Commission or interested parties to
have initiated FPA section 206 complaints against the RTOs or other entities with
interconnection delays, rather than to have proceeded generically in an effort to establish
uniformity.7 However, my preferences do not make this rule unlawful, and I am satisfied
that today’s rule is consistent with our legal obligations.
For these reasons, I respectfully concur.

(Issued July 28, 2023)
CLEMENTS, Commissioner, concurring:
1.
As the findings of this final rule illustrate, our nation is facing a grid infrastructure
crisis. Five years ago, the Commission issued Order No. 845 in an effort to improve
interconnection queue delays, noting that “despite Commission efforts to improve the
interconnection process . . . many interconnection customers experience delays, and some
interconnection queues have significant backlogs and long timelines.”1 Unfortunately,
the same observation can be made today, only the problem has gotten far worse.2 As of
the end of 2022, a staggering 10,000 projects representing over 2,000 GW of potential
generation and storage capacity are stuck in line to connect to the grid.3 That is nearly
double the 1,250 GW of total installed capacity in the United States today.4 Wait times
have “increased markedly,” with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab reporting that “[t]he
typical project built in 2022 took 5 years from the interconnection request to commercial
operations, compared to 3 years in 2015 and [less than] 2 years in 2008.”5 Meanwhile,

interconnection costs have increased significantly.6 Project completion rates are very
low,7 and late-stage withdrawal is becoming more common.8 In addition, the typical
timespan between the execution of a project’s interconnection agreement and its
commercial operations date has also increased, from roughly 17 months for projects built
between 2007-2014 to around 22 months for projects built between 2015-2022.9
2.
Ultimately, the dysfunction of the interconnection process harms consumers. It
prevents low-cost generation from coming online that could have reduced the cost of
electricity,10 and it harms reliability. Several of the nation’s largest grid operators have
stated that they could face resource adequacy problems if new resource entry does not
occur rapidly enough to match the pace of resource retirements.11 Given these
challenges and their attendant impacts on consumers, I enthusiastically support this final
rule, which includes a number of helpful reforms that will improve interconnection
processes across the country. The bulk of these reforms will widely extend proven best
practices to utilities around the country.
3.
What we have learned through consideration of comments to and stakeholder
engagement about the Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, however, is that

while this rule can be expected to improve matters, more will be necessary to solve the
problem. What was perhaps considered a straightforward kitchen renovation has become
more complicated. After we have removed the cabinets and taken out the drywall, we
have discovered outdated wires, rusted pipes and cracks in the foundation. None of these
additional challenges are insurmountable, but they are in some ways more fundamental to
getting that modern, working kitchen up and running.
4.
I therefore write separately to highlight some of the remaining issues and potential
solutions parties have brought forward that may address the remainder of the full
interconnection reform challenge, as well as to encourage stakeholders to remain focused
on taking additional critical steps toward addressing these issues.
5.
I do not suggest that solving the remaining challenges related to interconnection
will be easy. The record reveals quite the opposite. A comprehensive solution set will
require out-of-the-box thinking in some areas and continued incremental improvements
in others.
6.
Fortunately, we have received many thoughtful suggestions for further reforms,
which serve as the seeds for future solutions. Below, I discuss two categories of
promising ideas meriting further discussion: (1) deeper reforms that get at some of the
remaining fundamental challenges with interconnection processes; and (2) additional nuts
and bolts changes that could enhance the effectiveness of a variety of interconnection
processes, but which were not part of the proposal giving rise to this final rule.
7.
I urge stakeholders to examine these and related suggestions, and for transmission
planners to adopt regionally appropriate solutions beyond those required by this final
rule.

Deeper reforms

In considering interconnection processes across the country, twin challenges
emerge as the most fundamental problems. First, interconnection studies initially
examine clusters of projects that often bear little resemblance to what ultimately
interconnects to the system. They rely on a long and painful process of attrition to arrive
at a final set of projects along with corresponding network upgrades.
9.
More specifically, processes that rely solely on interconnection applications to
determine study scope, and which require substantial study work for each customer based
on inputs that depend on other projects in the queue, have become overwhelmed. For
example, S&P reports that the California Independent System Operator (CAISO)
received more than 350 GW of projects in its latest application window, driving its total

queue to over 500 GW.12 Meanwhile, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s
(MISO) queue has ballooned to 339 GW, while PJM Interconnection, LLC’s (PJM) has
risen to 298 GW, both comfortably greater than the present installed capacity of either
region.13 According to a recent CAISO stakeholder presentation, “[t]he massive increase
in interconnection requests seeking to meet the accelerated cadence of resource
development . . . has overwhelmed critical planning and engineering resources across the
industry. . . . The current generator interconnection processes simply cannot efficiently
accommodate the latest level of interconnection requests received.”14 Other queues are
similarly overwhelmed.15
10.
Second, project developers face enormous cost uncertainty.16 Initial study results
may be far different from final costs because the number of projects reaching the
facilities study stage (the final stage before the execution of a generator interconnection
agreement) can be far fewer than those earlier examined in the cluster study stage. As
CAISO observed in a recent stakeholder presentation, its “[s]tudy results lose accuracy,
meaning and utility when the level of cluster [Interconnection Resource] capacity [is]
multiple times the existing or planned transmission capacity for an area.”17

Today’s final rule will help to ameliorate these problems. In particular, the rule’s
site control requirements,18 requirement for an interconnection customer to select a
definitive point of interconnection,19 commercial readiness requirements,20 and
withdrawal penalty framework21 will each contribute to more streamlined study clusters.
As we have learned through this proceeding, however, they will likely be inadequate, on
their own, to fully solve these deep challenges.22
12.
In my estimation, the record of this proceeding, as well as recent stakeholder
initiatives, suggest several options for further improvement. They are not necessarily
exclusive of one another, and appropriate application may depend on the particular
regional context. They include: (1) linking the interconnection process to proactive
transmission system planning; (2) in applicable regions, aligning the interconnection
process more closely with competitive resource solicitations; and (3) transitioning to a
“focused” interconnection process or “connect and manage” approach for all energy-only
resources.

The Arizona Corporation Commission, for example, argues that ‘“first-ready’
queue reforms that are not explicitly linked to an effective rationing process will likely
fail to help resolve the growing backlog. Some mechanism to prioritize projects and
allocate scarce interconnection access to the highest quality projects is likely needed.”
Arizona Commission Initial Comments at 1-2. Similarly, a coalition of consumer groups
and the R Street Institute argues that the Commission’s notice of proposed rulemaking in
this proceeding “leaves many critical reforms unresolved.” R Street Institute et al. June

approach alone, without further changes, will not provide adequate reform”).

Commission’s notice of proposed rulemaking on regional planning and cost allocation,23
must also succeed. Interconnection processes are overloaded in part because they are
being relied on to build out core transmission system infrastructure that should be
considered in regional planning processes. We know interconnection processes were not
intended for, and are ill suited to perform, this task. As a coalition of consumer groups
and the R Street Institute argues in a recent letter to the Commission, “[t]he cost of
network upgrades can be dramatically reduced through proactive regional transmission
planning, which enables major reductions in [Generator Interconnection] requirements
and delays.”24 Even prior to the adoption of any final rule in the Commission’s regional
transmission planning proceeding, individual transmission providers can make significant
strides toward the cost-effective construction of new transmission infrastructure via
regionally tailored proposals and initiatives.25
14.
There may also be opportunities to streamline the interconnection process by more
closely linking it to the transmission system planning process,26 or to carry out forwardlooking interconnection studies driven by a more holistic assessment of interconnection
needs.
15.
Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and its stakeholders have embarked on a potentially
promising initiative along these lines, which proposes a “Consolidated Planning Process”
that would connect SPP’s interconnection process to its regional transmission planning
process.27 Similarly, CAISO is seeking to “[p]rioritize interconnection in zones where

transmission capacity exists or new transmission has been approved, while providing
opportunities to identify and provide alternative points of interconnection or upgrades.”28
Like SPP, CAISO aims to overhaul a bloated queue that requires initial studies that bear
little relation to transmission system reality, and instead chart a course to a new process
that produces “meaningful study results that take into account system capability, resource
planning and procurement.”29
16.
The promise of a forward-looking approach is also becoming clear through the
ongoing effort that MISO and SPP are pioneering in the affected systems context. That
effort, known as the Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue (JTIQ), examines a larger
portfolio of projects to identify solutions that more efficiently solve their collective

Recommendations (May 17, 2023), https://www.spp.org/spp-documents-filings/?id
=297513 (when accessing “CPPTF Meeting Materials 20230621”). SPP proposes to
calculate an “entry fee,” which would involve per-MW costs of any “regional” or “subregional” interconnection network infrastructure, along with a “local” component derived
from a narrower reliability assessment examining any necessary facilities at the point of
interconnection. See Southwest Power Pool, CPP Entry Fee Rate Structure, at 20 (July
14, 2023), https://www.spp.org/spp-documents-filings/?id=297513 (when accessing
“CPPTF Meeting Materials 20230714”) (setting forth entry fee components). The key to
SPP’s proposal, as I understand it, is that the regional and sub-regional components of the
entry fee would be identified by “forward-casting,” a “longer-term assessment” derived
from estimated costs of interconnecting resources in a fashion that is integrated with
SPP’s long-term regional plan. Id. By assessing costs across a broader range of projects
than any individual cluster, and by calculating it based on SPP’s proactive planning
vision rather than calculating costs for a hypothetical cluster of initial applicants that will
not all reach commercial operation, SPP may be able to offer far greater cost certainty for
project developers and thereby greatly streamline and accelerate the interconnection
process. Id. at 11, 19 (illustrating a greatly simplified flow chart for the consolidated
planning approach as compared to SPP’s status quo).

needs.30 By assessing larger, long-term system needs across study clusters, this approach
identifies efficiencies that could not be captured on a more project-specific basis.31
17.
As these regions’ proposals are still in flux and have yet to be filed with the
Commission, I do not prejudge them. But, at a high level, it appears that these types of
approaches may hold the potential to provide developers more certainty; avoid a dynamic
whereby large upgrades are assigned to individual projects that then drop from the queue,
causing a cascading need for restudy; and deliver benefits to consumers by identifying
more efficient infrastructure solutions than would be delivered on a piecemeal basis.
18.

Questions worth exploring as these types of processes develop include:
a. How can the process ensure that fees charged to interconnection customers
provide the funds needed for the relevant proactively-planned network
upgrades, while providing developers with a reasonable degree of cost
certainty?;
b. Would a mechanism such as a competitive auction or open season
administered by the transmission provider be an effective tool for allocating
scarce interconnection capacity identified by the forward-looking plans,
and/or are there other processes that can effectively streamline the study
process?;
c. How can such processes be designed in a manner that is not unduly
discriminatory and is consistent with open access principles?; and
d. What process is appropriate for interconnection applications that do not
align with the transmission provider’s forward-looking regional
transmission plan?

30

See generally SPP & MISO, SPP-MISO Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue
Cost Allocation and Affected System Study Process Changes White Paper (Dec. 20,
2022), https://www.spp.org/documents/68518/spp-miso%20jtiq%20study%20updated
%20white%20paper%2020221220.pdf. Because this approach looks at projects that have
reached the affected systems study stage, it does not provide a template for narrowing the
initial pool of projects to facilitate meaningful study results. But the forward-looking
nature of the initiative may nevertheless provide valuable insights to regional
interconnection processes more broadly.

Align interconnection processes with competitive resource solicitations

19.
In some regions of the country, it may be appropriate to link aspects of the
interconnection process to resource solicitation.32 The Colorado Public Utilities
Commission (Colorado Commission), for example, characterizes the interconnection
queue management processes of transmission providers in its state as “highly
functional.”33 The key, it says, is that its “existing FERC-approved tariffs and bilateral
market structure . . . ensures that projects selected in [its] competitive resource planning
and acquisition process obtain scarce interconnection in a cost-effective and timely
manner.”34
20.
The Colorado Commission and Arizona Corporation Commission (Arizona
Commission) argue that a mechanism to allocate scarce interconnection capacity is
needed.35 The Colorado Commission explains that if there is 400 MW of low-cost
headroom on the system, for instance, several commercially viable projects that
collectively exceed that amount may compete for that headroom yet be unviable on a
collective basis if all proceed.36 It contends that, lacking a mechanism to allocate the
headroom, a cluster study process may result in an inefficient cycle of study, re-study and
delay, without necessarily ensuring that the 400 MW of headroom is used efficiently.37 It
argues that facilitating a process where state-jurisdictional competitive solicitation can be
used to allocate scarce interconnection capacity is appropriate given “state priorities
involving reliability, customer, and environmental preferences.”38

32

See, e.g., Clean Energy Associations Initial Comments at 38 (urging the
acceptance of “regionally specific proposals that would align the interconnection process
with competitive procurements associated with resource planning, rather than placing
them at odds”). Such alignment may not be appropriate or feasible, of course, in certain
multi-state regions in which the bulk of resource development is driven by anticipated
market revenues.

FERC proposed a similar “optional resource solicitation” study in this proceeding.
Our proposed process differed in a critical respect: the resource solicitation was not
granted a queue position,39 and being selected in the resource solicitation would not serve
as a mechanism for allocating scarce interconnection capacity. The possibility of more
comprehensively aligning the interconnection process with competitive resource
solicitations (beyond the jurisdictions where such an approach is currently used) raises
many questions, such as:
a. How can competitive solicitations and interconnection processes be designed
to effectively coordinate with one another, especially where the soliciting
entity (e.g., a state) is different from the transmission provider (e.g., an RTO)?
b. To be effective as a mechanism to allocate scarce interconnection capacity,
must a competitive solicitation be paired with a mechanism such as further
strengthened commercial readiness requirements to limit the pool of resources
in the queue not responding to solicitations, or be designed in a fashion that
limits the interactions in the study process between resources responding to the
relevant solicitation(s) and those that do not?40 Can such requirements be
designed in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory, and if so, how?
39

Commenters argue that the Commission should have proposed to grant a queue
position to the resource solicitation. See, e.g., Colorado Commission Reply Comments at
6; EEI Initial Comments at 5-6; Xcel Initial Comments at 11-14; Clean Energy
Associations Initial Comments at 51. Without a queue position for the resource
solicitation, the costs identified in the study may not hold true for the various queue
positions of underlying resources.
40

The Colorado Commission argues that if projects to be studied as part of a
competitive solicitation request are “comingled with a much broader pool of speculative
projects,” the process could become “unworkable.” Colorado Commission Reply
Comments at 5. It argues that, in the RTO context, commercial readiness requirements
will be inadequate for this task, and suggests that the Commission allow transmission
providers to prioritize native load, using solicitations as a mechanism to allocate scarce
interconnection capacity. See Colorado Commission Initial Comments at 21-30. In
contrast, the Interwest Energy Alliance argues that while competitive resource
solicitations could be a useful tool to organize a portion of the interconnection process,
they should not “becom[e] the only pathway through the cluster study process,” because
“alternative pathways with reasonable commercial readiness requirements may . . . reveal
opportunities for independent transmission companies (potentially associated with
independent generation developers) to discover cost-effective ways to add much-needed
transmission expansion through additional lines along with additional interconnection
capacity.” Interwest Initial Comments at 11-12. Alternatives may be available that allow
for other development opportunities alongside resources solicitation clusters. For

c. Are safeguards necessary to render not unduly discriminatory an
interconnection process closely linked to a competitive solicitation process,
and if so, what safeguards are necessary or appropriate?41
d. Is linking the interconnection process to competitive solicitations a viable
option in RTO regions, in which state solicitation processes play a large role
in supporting new market entrants but other paths to commercial viability
may also exist?
C.

Facilitate a “focused” interconnection process

22.
Other promising ideas for improving cost certainty and reducing delays were put
forward to the Commission in this proceeding. In particular, several commenters endorse
a more “focused” interconnection process that streamlines study scope and reduces the
need for restudies for projects requesting energy-only service.42 As Enel observes, the
example, a resource solicitation might be granted its own cluster (so as to allow the
soliciting entity to understand the interconnection costs for its combination of resources),
while providing for serial processing of clusters composed of resources not participating
in the resource solicitation. See Enel Initial Comments at 72 (arguing that if the
Commission were to adopt an optional resource solicitation process that designated a
queue position, it “should be a separate queue cycle with an intermediate queue priority
between the Transmission Provider’s annual study clusters”).
41

Several entities highlighted the need for guardrails to prevent undue
discrimination with regard to the Commission’s proposal of an optional resource
solicitation study. See, e.g., R Street Initial Comments at 15-16 (“Guardrails may be
helpful to prevent inefficiencies, preference or undue discrimination”); NARUC Initial
Comments at 26 (“NARUC strongly supports FERC’s proposal to limit the applicability
of the optional resource solicitation study to instances where the resource acquisition is
overseen by a state regulatory authority and is competitive and open. Without this
requirement, NARUC is concerned about the opportunity for load-serving entities to
potentially use the process in a way that would inappropriately favor the interconnection
of company-owned resources.”); Pine Gate Initial Comments at 43 (advocating for
“appropriate safeguards”). This concern is heightened in the context where the
solicitation is granted a queue position, and/or where inclusion in the solicitation serves
as a commercial readiness indicator.
42

See, e.g., R Street Institute et al. June 8, 2023 Comments in Support of
Generator Interconnection Reform, at 2 (urging the Commission to “[c]onsider a focused
interconnection study approach”); Public Interest Organizations Initial Comments at 5052 (highlighting the potential for a narrow study process for ERIS resources to produce
significantly faster interconnection timelines); ACORE Initial Comments at 2-3

dilemma of unwieldy studies and cascading restudy needs, and the delay and cost
uncertainty that stems from these challenges, is ultimately caused by “the
interdependence amongst Interconnection Customers.”43 Cypress Creek notes that “[i]n
one extreme example, a group of non-firm, energy-only resource interconnection service
(‘ERIS’) requests triggered the need for upgrades up to 1,000 miles away on three
different systems.”44 Accordingly, another way to facilitate a more workable
interconnection process could be to focus study of new projects on their immediate
impact to the system. While the number of studies pursuant to such a process could still
be large, their scope would be smaller and the potential for cascading restudies would be
greatly reduced.
23.
Johannes Pfeifenberger of The Brattle Group notes that, using a “connect and
manage” approach, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has
interconnected more generation more quickly than other regions.45 Under its system,
which “limits restudy needs,” “[p]rojects can be developed and interconnected within 2-3
years,” while “in other regions, the interconnection study process itself may take longer
than that.”46 Public Interest Organizations state that “[t]he UK’s ‘Connect and Manage’
approach has reduced lead times by 5 years compared to its previous ‘Invest and
Connect’ approach.”47

24.
While ERCOT’s system, which treats all generators as energy-only resources,48
may not provide a model for capacity resources, it could provide a template for ERIS
interconnection. Enel argues that a “focused” approach to interconnection is appropriate
for resources seeking ERIS because “the Transmission Provider is not obligated to
maintain the transmission system such that ERIS generators can maintain the same level
of as available injection throughout the life of the generator,” and accordingly, “it would
be unreasonable to expect an ERIS generator to mitigate every constraint identified” in a
more expansive study that uses a lower transfer distribution factor (TDF) threshold to
identify more remote impacts of the project.49 Streamlining ERIS interconnection
assessment could allow transmission providers to focus their study resources on a smaller
number of requests seeking network resource interconnection service (NRIS).50
25.
Cypress Creek argues that a more focused study approach could be implemented
across the many regions that provide an NRIS interconnection option through use of a
“two-step ERIS-NRIS” process by which the transmission provider could by default
study all resources for ERIS and provide a subsequent process by which an
interconnection customer can add firm rights.51 Such a process might even feasibly
provide a faster path to commercial operation while still facilitating deliverable resources
in the long run if “NRIS requests [could] be connected more quickly on an ERIS basis
while NRIS-related network upgrade study and construction work is still pending.”52
While the final rule did not adopt the recommendation for a two-step study process
because it was outside the scope of this proceeding,53 individual transmission providers
could propose to implement such a process on their own initiative or the Commission
could take up this suggestion in a subsequent rulemaking.

Key questions that this approach raises include:
a. What is the appropriate mechanism to narrow the scope of ERIS studies to
limit the interdependence of projects in the study process? For example, Enel
argues that ERIS resources should be studied using a minimum TDF threshold
of 20 percent,54 and that transmission providers should replace power flow
models that assume extreme grid conditions with more realistic economic
dispatch models reflecting security constrained economic dispatch.55 How do
these approaches interact and are they mutually exclusive? Are there other
appropriate mechanisms?
b. To the extent that ERIS studies are narrowed, are changes to market dispatch
rules or other measures appropriate to account for the possibility that NRIS
resources or resources with long-term firm transmission service may be
curtailed before them?56
c. If a two-step study process that considers ERIS analysis first is appropriate,
how should it be designed?57 Would it be effective to provide for a process
that allows ERIS resources to be converted to NRIS after they are
constructed?58

Xcel objects to the treatment of ERIS resources in RTO markets because
“[t]hese resources do not bear the costs necessary to ensure that they are deliverable to
load as NRIS resources or ERIS resources that have acquired long term firm transmission
service do,” and suggests that, as a consequence, it may be appropriate for “ERIS-only
service [to] receive a lower dispatch priority.” Xcel Initial Comments at 15-16.
57

Some regions currently employ a similar two-step process that considers local
project needs prior to considering deliverability analysis non-local upgrades based on
project interactions. See, e.g., New York State Department Initial Comments at 5-6
(describing NYISO’s Class Year study process).

See Public Interest Organizations Initial Comments at 52 (arguing that
“[i]deally, the interconnecting customer would receive an upfront estimate of typical
curtailment levels to be expected under ERIS and would have the option to apply for
NRIS at a later date if experienced curtailment levels rise above acceptable levels”).

d. Could a focused interconnection approach for ERIS resources be combined
with approaches above that may align the interconnection process more
closely with long-term transmission planning, and/or use competitive
selection processes to allocate scarce interconnection capacity?59
II. General interconnection process improvements
27.
In addition to these deeper reforms, commenters identified several potential
incremental improvements to interconnection processes that were not proposed in the
Commission’s notice of proposed rulemaking. I discuss some of the most promising
ideas below, which in some or most cases may be applicable on a generic basis.60
A.

Further refine study assumptions

28.
Commenters identified a number of ways that study assumptions could be further
clarified, which may help to streamline and improve the accuracy of the interconnection
process.
1.

Clarify ERIS and NRIS assumptions

29.
As Enel points out, the Commission has not to date clarified what ERIS studies
should entail, and it has “observed vastly different treatments of” resources seeking ERIS
by different transmission providers.61 As discussed above, a narrow approach to ERIS
studies may facilitate a more streamlined interconnection process. In addition, some

Might such a process be able to efficiently examine a large number of projects, while still
requiring significantly fewer restudies than existing interconnection processes by
examining only projects that have already secured ERIS?
59

For example, might a transmission provider efficiently assess ERIS upgrades by
studying them using a distribution factor of 20 percent, while simultaneously developing
an “entry fee” or open season process aligned with its forward-looking transmission plan
to fund upgrades to guarantee deliverability of NRIS resources?

reliability issues that are identified.62 They argue that requiring “a uniform set of
minimum interconnection study requirements” would “facilitate effective, efficient
interconnection queue processing.”63
30.
While the Commission declined to provide direction on how ERIS should be
studied because such requests were outside the scope of this final rule,64 the Commission
could take up this topic as part of a subsequent rulemaking. As an initial step, the
Commission could solicit information from transmission providers documenting what
assumptions and processes are used for ERIS and NRIS, respectively, to provide a
starting point for dialogue around what study assumptions may be appropriate.65 Topics
that may benefit from further clarification include: (1) the definition and scope of ERIS;
(2) the study assumptions that should be implemented in examining ERIS requests; and
(3) the proper scope of study results and other information that must be provided by
transmission providers to interconnection customers so that they can understand the
results.

energy by resources

charging behavior of electric storage resources extends only to “the operating

assumptions for withdrawals of energy.”66 In part due to concerns regarding the
administrative burden of extending the proposal to injections or other resource types, the
final rule declines to extend the reform in these areas.67 But while the Commission
determined that this record did not support adopting a structure where such assumptions
would be studied at the request of individual generators, further examination of how to
render operating assumptions more accurate is warranted.
32.
Many commenters argued that the Commission should also require more accurate
assumptions regarding injections of storage.68 And as the final rule acknowledges, many
commenters “support eliminating unrealistic interconnection study assumptions for
resource types other than electric storage resources, such as assuming that a solar facility
will operate at night, or that a wind resource will produce maximum output during lowwind seasons.”69 Further, several commenters highlighted the benefits of using realistic
fuel-based dispatch assumptions in studies, as demonstrated by MISO.70 The final rule

B.

Use automation to facilitate more efficient interconnection

33.
Currently, the interconnection study and queue process is heavily labor-intensive,
and market participants frequently suffer from shortages of qualified study staff,
including transmission planners and engineers, in the face of a high volume of
interconnection requests.72 Accordingly, numerous commenters noted the great potential
of automation to conserve staffing resources and speed up this process.73 The broad term
“automation” in this context can refer to a wide variety of time-saving steps to bring the
dispatch of generators in modeling “[i]f Power flow analyses are not replaced with SCED
studies”); Interwest Reply Comment at 15 (urging the adoption of “realistic fuel-based
dispatch assumptions”).

queue process fully into the digital age, such as standardized data entry and collection; a
web-based application process and data submission with automated validation; automated
study model construction and study processes; and pre-population of manufacturer
models for relevant equipment.74 Commenters requested steps, including the convening
of a technical conference, to study how the interconnection process might become more
robustly automated to save resources75 and facilitate other benefits, such as the more
robust integration of grid enhancing technologies (referred to as “alternative transmission
technologies” in the final rule) into the bulk power system.76 Of course, continuing to
support career path development in this area will remain critical. At the same time, as we
have seen in many other industries, automation done right has the potential to save a great
deal of unnecessary time, effort, and expense. I support more deeply exploring the range
of options available in this domain.
C.

Reduce delay and cost overruns in network upgrade construction

34.
While there appears to be a lack of good data about the timing and cost of
construction of network upgrades once an interconnection agreement is executed,77
developers have raised concerns that they have little recourse if such upgrades are
delayed or subject to cost increases.78 As noted above, the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory’s Queued Up report does not trace the cause of delays between execution of a
project’s interconnection agreement and commercial operation, but shows that the
average timespan for this period has increased from roughly 17 months for projects built
between 2007-2014 to around 22 months for projects built between 2015-2022, with
projects in CAISO showing particularly heightened delays.79 Enel contends that

for interconnection customers to self build will “further exacerbate construction delays
and . . . ultimately harm consumers”).

See Queued Up 2023 at 30. “The typical solar project built in CAISO since
2018 took over 4 years to reach commercial operations after securing an interconnection

“upgrades for Interconnection Customers are only overseen by the Commission for
adherence to good utility practice standards,” and “[t]he Commission does not review the
timeliness or cost of upgrades unless an Interconnection Customer elects to file an LGIA
in unexecuted form and challenge these specific assumptions,” a choice that could result
in “costly delays in project timelines that often outweigh any benefit that might be gained
from a favorable Commission decision.”80
35.
Accordingly, it may be appropriate for the Commission to take action to facilitate
more timely and cost-conscious construction of such upgrades. One initial step could be
for the Commission to gather more data concerning delays that may affect the
commercial operation date of a generating facility, and to establish “metrics associated
with the delayed construction of facilities.”81 The Commission could also consider
adopting penalties for delays or cost overruns, or an incentive structure for transmission
providers that carry out construction on time and on budget.82
36.
Finally, it may be appropriate to reconsider the scope of “stand alone network
upgrades” to include facilities that may be needed for multiple interconnection customers,
and to develop a process that either designates an interconnection customer to build such
upgrades, or competitively solicits bids to award construction rights. While this final rule
“clarif[ies] that, for a network upgrade to be eligible for treatment as a stand alone
network upgrade, the network upgrade must be required for only one interconnection

agreement; those built in 2022 averaged over 6 years.” Id. (emphasis in original).

This issue has also arisen in the context of the Commission’s docket on
transmission planning and cost management. See, e.g., Advanced Energy Economy, PreConference Comments, Docket No. AD22-8, at 2-3 (filed Oct. 4, 2022) (noting that a
“major driver[] of transmission cost increases in recent years [has] been . . . incremental
network upgrades identified in generator interconnection studies”). In that docket, the
Commission has considered, and some commenters have supported, among other
measures, new independent entities to monitor transmission planning. See, e.g.,
Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition, Comments, Docket No. AD22-8, at 6
(filed Oct. 4, 2022); Harvard Electricity Law Initiative, Comment, Docket No. AD22-8,
at 18-31 (filed Mar. 23, 2023); R Street Institute, Comments, Docket No. AD22-8, at 6-7
(filed Mar. 23, 2023). To the extent that such entities are established, the Commission
could also consider tasking them with monitoring the timely and cost-conscious
construction of network upgrades.

customer,”83 it does so in order to “explicitly maintain[] the status quo.”84 The
Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking examined changes to the definition of
stand alone network upgrade necessary “to implement a first-ready, first-served cluster
study process,”85 and did not contemplate any mechanism to “prevent lengthy conflict
and negotiations in instances where multiple interconnection requests trigger the need for
a network upgrade” beyond restricting such upgrades to those that are required for only
one interconnection customer.86
37.
Ideas were put forth in this proceeding, however, that may hold potential to
efficiently allocate construction rights and obligations. In particular, one idea is that “the
Commission should consider establishing a new third-party construction option” pursuant
to which stand alone network upgrades could “be bid out and built by third parties, such
as non-incumbent utilities, independent transmission developers or contractors.”87 To
develop such an option, the Commission would need to consider “details such as the
posting of minimum design standards that must be met, the criteria for choosing a
winning bidder, the incentives to hold the winning bidder to cost and schedule estimates,
responsibility for cost overruns, rights to own, operate and maintain the Stand-Alone
Network Upgrades, and the profit awarded to the winning bidder.”88 Further process is
warranted to examine this concept.89 I encourage transmission providers to work with

D.

Address challenges faced by projects serving Tribes and Tribal
communities

38.
Beyond these recommendations to further facilitate efficient interconnection of
new resources, I encourage transmission providers to examine potential changes to
address important considerations of equity and fairness related to interconnection of
resources serving or developed by Tribes. In particular, I encourage transmission
providers to examine whether any exceptions or waivers to the commercial readiness
requirements or withdrawal penalties framework are appropriate for certain projects
serving Tribal nations or their communities. While the commercial readiness deposit and
withdrawal framework adopted in this final rule hold the potential to make
interconnection processes more efficient, they may act as a barrier to projects serving or
developed by Tribes in cases where such projects adopt unique ownership and financing
structures.90 This may also be a concern with regard to projects developed by, or in
partnership with, communities that have been historically marginalized or overburdened
by pollution, and I encourage further dialogue examining whether that is the case.
39.
For example, the Commission recently granted a waiver to the SAGE
Development Authority (SAGE), an entity developing a wind generation project on
Tribal land, to allow it more time to post financial security as required by SPP.91 SAGE
was created by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and is developing the project through “a
community-led process designed to, among other things, implement Tribal values and
ensure that the financial benefits of the Project will in turn support further community
projects intended to address disparities around public health and other issues.”92 The
Commission granted SAGE’s requested waiver in part because “due to its unique Tribal
business structure, it [was] unable to secure credit in advance” of the relevant security

mechanisms to further explore and develop these details.” Id.
90

See OSPA Initial Comments at 8, 15-16 (arguing that SPP’s current security
deposit regime has been “an insuperable barrier to renewable energy development on
Tribal lands”).

deposit deadline.93 Waiver “provide[d] SAGE the time necessary to secure additional
credit.”94
40.
To the extent this rule’s deposit requirements subject Tribal projects to greater
risk, the need for similar waivers could be heightened. Accordingly, I encourage further
inquiry into whether certain projects developed to serve Tribal communities or
disadvantaged communities may have other characteristics that uniquely demonstrate
commercial readiness as alternatives to the new deposit requirements. The inquiry could
also consider other measures that may allow such projects to overcome any unique
barriers that they face.95
41.
While challenges remain, the Commission’s issuance of a final rule today is an
important step forward in the effort to address interconnection backlogs around the
country. The ideas for continuing reform that I describe in this concurrence represent
best practices and innovative thinking by regions and stakeholders considering how to
solve the challenges the final rule does not address. I encourage transmission providers,
interconnection customers and other stakeholders to consider the rule’s requirements a
strong baseline and not a ceiling, and to continue to engage on the topics I have addressed
herein.
For these reasons, I respectfully concur.

FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
Improvements to Generator Interconnection Procedures
and Agreements

Docket No. RM22-14-000

(Issued July 28, 2023)
CHRISTIE, Commissioner, concurring:
I concur to this final rule,1 which represents major progress towards the primary
goal we set out to accomplish last year when we issued the NOPR: To move from a
system of “first come, first served” to a system of “first ready, first served” by identifying
generation projects in the interconnection queues that are commercially more viable and
then moving them ahead of requests that are speculative and which have been causing
major backlogs. I write separately about four issues contained within:
I.

Evaluation of Alternative Transmission Technologies (Section III.C.2.iii)

Alternative transmission technologies, or grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), is a
short-hand categorical term that covers a sweeping array of very different technologies.
A GET may hold the potential of squeezing more juice – literally – out of the existing
transmission grid. By increasing the capacity of the existing grid, a GET could reduce or
even eliminate the need for the future construction of new transmission assets. So the
potential for cost-savings from the use of GETs is too important to ignore.
One of the most promising GETs – dynamic line ratings (DLRs) – could
potentially save billions of dollars in avoided costs for new transmission assets. DLRs
are not covered by this final rule, but are the subject of a separate proceeding,2 and I hope
we will use the record of that proceeding to move forward on a proposed rule to require
implementation of DLRs when and where DLRs will be technologically sound and costeffective.
While DLRs have tremendous potential and should be pursued, there is a problem
with any categorical regulatory mandate to use GETs, which is this: Some GETs work
somewhere but not everywhere; some work sometimes but not all the time; some only
work under certain weather conditions; some don’t work at all, or at least not as

advertised; and some are only cost-effective where the congestion costs are greater than
the cost of the GET itself.
Given these engineering and economic realities, some knowledgeable transmission
planning experts have argued that GETs categorically are not planning tools, but rather
are operational applications that should be deployed when and where their efficacy is
likely and can be appropriately proven. If they work in the real world as advertised, they
could reduce or eliminate the need for future network upgrades or even backbone
transmission assets, but they should not be mandated as planning tools or as potential
substitutes for network upgrades caused by interconnection requests.3
Against this cautious view of GETs, I recognize the counterargument that
transmission owners themselves have an economic incentive to favor the construction of
costly new transmission assets rather than deploy GETs to squeeze out more capacity.
New transmission assets can be rate-based, and the transmission owner can take
advantage of the very generous formula rate treatment offered here at the Commission
(another issue I have raised concerns about).4 So to overcome this incentive against
GETs deployment, proponents argue that the Commission should require it.
3

See PJM Initial Comments at 68 (“PJM therefore cautions the Commission not to
conflate the operational benefits of alternative transmission technologies . . . with the
need to address significant capacity enhancement needs (short and long-term) or longrange transmission needs under rapid growth or changing resource mix scenarios.”);
MISO Initial Comments at 121-22 (“Further, although these technologies may be
evaluated, the technologies identified by the Commission still may not provide the
appropriate solution from a planning perspective. Many of the technologies identified
are appropriately considered as operational tools or short-term solutions but are not
necessarily appropriate for planning to support a particular generator interconnection.”)
(emphases added, footnote omitted).

See, e.g., Sw. Power Pool, Inc., 183 FERC ¶ 61,151 (2023) (Clements, Comm’r,
and Christie, Comm’r, concurring at P 4) (“Indeed, the Commission grants formula rate
treatment, including a presumption of prudence, to filings from transmission owners
seeking cost recovery for transmission projects without regard to whether such projects
have been subject to a serious vetting in any proceeding in which both need and prudence
of cost must be demonstrated by the transmission developer. We have expressed
concerns about this lack of oversight previously, and this filing by SPP illustrates exactly
why that is a major problem pertinent to the issue of rising consumer costs for
transmission.”), https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/commissioner-clements-andcommissioner-christies-joint-concurrence-spp-project; Transmission Planning and Cost

But – as usual – the economic incentives argument has more than one side. The
companies that sell GETs (and the organizations they fund) stand to profit from any
regulation mandating that their products must be used. And generation developers (and
the organizations they fund) have every incentive to lobby for a regulation mandating the
use of GETS as a way to avoid paying the costs of the traditional network upgrades made
necessary by their interconnections. This incentive is particularly salient in RTOs/ISOs
that use participant funding to pay for the costs of network upgrades caused by the
interconnecting customers (i.e., developers).
So – again, as usual with sweeping Commission regulations – there is plenty of
rent-seeking to go around. Striking the appropriate balance – one that is in the public
interest – is a challenge. I believe this final rule – unlike the NOPR – does strike the right
balance, in terms of a requirement simply to evaluate GETs in determining the
appropriate network upgrade.
Importantly, the final rule makes it explicitly clear that while it is requiring the
evaluation of certain listed GETs in the interconnection studies process, it is not requiring
– nor even suggesting – that a GET must be deployed as an alternative to a necessary
network upgrade. Indeed, the final rule explicitly says:
This final rule does not create a presumption in favor
of substituting alternative transmission technologies
for necessary traditional network upgrades, either
categorically or in specific cases. This final rule is
agnostic as to whether, in a specific case, an alternative
transmission technology is an acceptable alternative to
a traditional network upgrade . . . .
The final rule also makes it explicitly clear that the determination in each case is to
be made at the sole discretion of the transmission provider (i.e., RTO/ISOs or non-RTO
transmission providers), applying good utility practices, applicable reliability standards,
and other applicable regulatory requirements. To avoid continual litigation aimed at the
transmission provider’s determination in specific cases when a generation developer does
not want to pay the costs of a network upgrade, the final rule explicitly makes clear that it
is requiring a process of evaluation, not mandating outcomes in specific cases. And it
makes clear that if the transmission provider performs the evaluation as required in the
final rule, it has complied with the final rule.
This agnosticism as to outcomes in specific cases is critically important.
Transmission providers must require the appropriate network upgrade necessary to fix the
reliability issue caused by the interconnection request. If a GET is used instead, and it
fails to fix the reliability issue caused by the interconnection, a later network upgrade will
be required, one potentially more costly than the network upgrade originally required.
And who will pay those costs? Certainly in RTOs/ISOs using participant funding, load

Document Accession #: 20230728-3060

(retail consumers) should not. Sticking those costs on consumers would raise a serious
question of unjust and unreasonable rates.
In summary though, I believe that this final rule strikes the appropriate balance
between requiring the evaluation of GETs, but not mandating the use of a GET in specific
cases unless the transmission provider – and only the transmission provider – determines
it would work from a real-world applicability standpoint. In all cases, the transmission
provider should apply its engineering expertise to come to the right determination as to
the necessary network upgrades. This final rule requires nothing less.
II.

Repayment of Affected Systems Network Upgrade Costs
(Section III.B.2.c.iii(c))

The final rule essentially codifies existing precedent as to the repayment of
affected systems network upgrade costs when a generation developer interconnects at or
near a seam between an RTO (which uses participant funding to pay for interconnection
costs) and a non-RTO, vertically integrated load-serving utility that uses a crediting
mechanism.
Three recent cases involving Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke) in North
Carolina5 illustrate my concern about the Commission’s repayment policy.6 In these
cases, generation developers located within the PJM footprint, which extends into a
corner of northeastern North Carolina due to Dominion Energy, Inc.’s PJM membership,

chose to interconnect very close to the seam with Duke’s North Carolina territory. Duke
is a vertically integrated utility regulated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission
(NCUC) on an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) model. Duke builds transmission (and
generation) subject to an IRP approved by the NCUC, and the costs of network upgrades
caused by that new generation are paid by retail consumers. Since the NCUC approves
new generation through its IRP process, which includes the costs to interconnect that new
generation, the NCUC decides the generation and interconnection costs that are
appropriately paid for by retail consumers.
In these three cases, however, Duke was considered an “affected system” for the
interconnection costs caused by the generation developers located just across the seam in
PJM’s footprint. So the affected systems network upgrades were not paid by the
developer (creating an incentive to locate close to the seam), but by Duke’s retail
consumers through crediting pursuant to Commission policy. And unlike the costs of
transmission and network upgrades built with the prior approval of the NCUC, no stateapproved IRP controls the construction of generation in the PJM footprint in North
Carolina. Not surprisingly, the NCUC and the NCUC Public Staff, which represents
consumers in North Carolina, filed vigorous – and in my opinion, persuasive – comments
in several proceedings on these issues.7

party that is both causing the costs to be incurred and reaping the resulting benefits; that
given the proliferation of merchant generation trying to locate in this area of North
Carolina, the NCUC Public Staff is concerned that Duke ratepayers will be burdened with
potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in affected systems network upgrade cost as a
result of the Commission’s actions; and that the project in American Beech had not yet
received a CPCN from North Carolina so any decision put the “cart before the horse.”).

While I recognize that the results in these cases were consistent with prior
precedent and Order No. 2003,8 I think that precedent and, if necessary, Order No. 2003
itself, should be revisited as to the affected systems repayment policy. I concur to the
issuance of this final rule because this final rule is not the appropriate place to revisit the
issue and because the final rule by its own terms does not go beyond existing precedent.
III.

Inappropriate Allocation of Certain Costs to Consumers

As described below, while I support the final rule, I am concerned that study delay
penalties on RTOs/ISOs and the costs of transmission provider heatmaps used as a tool
for interconnection customers will be inappropriately allocated to consumers even though
they both appear to provide much more of a benefit to generation developers than
consumers. I address each in turn.
A.

Study Delay Penalties on RTO/ISOs (Section III.B.1.c.x)

The final rule adopts the NOPR proposal to eliminate the reasonable efforts
standard from the pro forma LGIP, and it adds a new section to the pro forma LGIP that
imposes penalties on transmission providers who miss study deadlines. I have no qualms
about assessing penalties on non-RTO/ISO transmission providers and transmissionowning members of RTOs/ISOs. These are generally investor-owned companies and
stockholders will bear such costs. On the other hand, I have concerns about assessing
study penalties on RTOs/ISOs, as they are not-for-profit entities who do not have
stockholders. In my concurrence to the NOPR, I explained:
[T]he penalty provisions do not answer definitively the most
important question of all: Who will pay these penalties in an
RTO or ISO which has no stockholders? Consumers
certainly should not pay, directly or indirectly.9
The final rule does not fully address this question and does not provide complete
assurance that consumers will be protected.
However, the final rule does have some protections in place to protect against
consumers ultimately having to pay for study delay penalties. First, the final rule
modifies the NOPR proposal to prohibit non-RTO/ISO transmission providers and

transmission-owning members of RTOs/ISOs from recovering study delay penalty
amounts through transmission rates.10 Second, the final rule modifies the NOPR proposal
to adopt a new provision in our regulations specifying that, for RTOs/ISOs in which the
transmission-owning members perform certain interconnection studies, the study delay
penalties will automatically be imposed directly on the transmission-owning member(s)
that conducted the late study.
But these provisions still leave open the question of how RTOs/ISOs will recover
those study delay penalties that are not automatically imposed on a transmission-owning
member. The final rule essentially punts on this question, explaining that RTOs/ISOs
may submit an FPA section 205 filing to propose a default structure for recovering study
delay penalties and/or make individual FPA section 205 filings to recover the costs of any
specific study delay penalties. I urge that any such RTO/ISO filing make protections to
consumers paramount.
B.

Cost of Heatmap (Section III.A.1.c.iii)

This final rule requires transmission providers to publicly post a “heatmap” with
certain information after the completion of each cluster study and cluster restudy period.
The final rule finds that the heatmap will benefit interconnection customers, including
prospective interconnection customers, by providing them further transparency as to
expected congestion and potential network upgrades and therefore will reduce the
number of speculative interconnection requests. I agree that a requirement to post a
heatmap will greatly benefit interconnection customers and support the requirement’s
addition to the pro forma LGIP.
Where I am concerned, however, is how the heatmap should be funded. The final
rule clarifies that transmission providers, not interconnection customers, are responsible
for paying the costs associated with the heatmap requirement. Further, the final rule
contemplates transmission providers recovering the costs of the heatmap from
transmission customers and ex ante determines that such rate treatment is appropriate
because interconnection queue efficiency benefits transmission customers. Commission
policy may dictate that interconnection queue efficiency benefits transmission
customers;11 however, that should not result in the costs of a requirement that best
benefits interconnection customers, and really prospective interconnection customers that
may ultimately not seek to interconnect, being recovered from consumers through
transmission rates carte blanche. The Commission simply cannot ask retail consumers to
foot the bill for every single “efficiency,” especially where many of these “efficiencies”

Whether or not I agree with Commission policy is another matter entirely. See,
e.g., supra PP 13-16.

largely benefit generation developers and then get folded into transmission rates and
receive an ROE.12
I believe this issue merits further scrutiny, and I look forward to future comments
on this issue.
IV.

“Hold Harmless” Provisions (Sections I, III.A.6.c.iii, IV.C)

In my concurrence to the NOPR, I wrote that while I supported the proposed
queue reforms (subject, of course, to comment):
I also caution strongly that we should avoid undermining
through this NOPR what the RTOs/ISOs, working through
their stakeholder processes, are already doing to fix their own
queue problems. We should recognize that each RTO/ISO is
different and faces unique local challenges and needs. The
queue reforms proposed in today’s NOPR should be seen
more as guideposts or general standards rather than
unyielding mandates that refuse to take local solutions into
consideration. I would allow RTOs/ISOs the opportunity to
demonstrate that if their own efforts to enact queue reforms
achieve the same goals in a different, but equally effective
manner, their individual reform may be acceptable in
complying with any final rule. While this NOPR currently
recognizes the potential for regional flexibility, I hope the
need for such flexibility is explicitly memorialized in any
final rule.13
This final rule contains language that is intended to recognize the earnest and
good-faith efforts undertaken by the RTOs to enact queue reforms. Some RTOs, such as

put this in context, and talk about what’s really at stake here. Last year national
transmission rate base went up over 9 percent. That’s the third consecutive year it’s gone
up over 9 percent. What goes into rate base, goes into consumer’s bills. Every nickel.
And in the last decade, national transmission rate base has almost tripled, and . . . at 9
percent it’s going to double again in the next eight years. This is all going into
customer’s bills. So this is a hugely important issue. This is a ton of money, this is big,
big money.”).

PJM, have already launched extensive queue reforms; others, such as CAISO, are hard at
work on developing queue reforms.
I concur because this final rule does contain language that is at least intended to
recognize the efforts of RTOs to act on their own queue reforms without waiting on a
Commission rulemaking. Whether the language of this final rule adequately recognizes
or “holds harmless” those efforts will be an issue for compliance filings.
For these reasons, I concur.
